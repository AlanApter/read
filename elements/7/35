If two numbers (both) measure some number then the least (number) measured by them will also measure the same (number).

For let two numbers, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, (both) measure some number {CD magnitude}, and (let) {E magnitude} (be the) least (number measured by both {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}).
I say that {E magnitude} also measures {CD magnitude}.

For if {E magnitude} does not measure {CD magnitude} then let {E magnitude} leave {CF magnitude} less than itself (in) measuring {DF magnitude}.
And since {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (both) measure {E magnitude}, and {E magnitude} measures {DF magnitude}, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} will thus also measure {DF magnitude}.
And ({A magnitude} and {B magnitude}) also measure the whole of {CD magnitude}.
Thus, they will also measure the remainder {CF magnitude}, which is less than {E magnitude}.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {E magnitude} cannot not measure {CD magnitude}.
Thus, ({E magnitude}) measures ({CD magnitude}).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
