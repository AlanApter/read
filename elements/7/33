To find the least of those (numbers) having the same ratio as any given multitude of numbers.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} be any given multitude of numbers.
So it is required to find the least of those (numbers) having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.

For {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} are either prime to one another, or not.
In fact, if {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} are prime to one another then they are the least of those (numbers) having the same ratio as them [Prop. 7.22].

And if not, let the greatest common measure, {D magnitude}, of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} have be taken [Prop. 7.3].
And as many times as {D magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, so many units let there be in {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, respectively.
And thus {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} measure {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, respectively, according to the units in {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.15].
Thus, {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} measure {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (respectively) an equal number of times.
Thus, {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} are in the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (respectively) [Def. 7.20].
So I say that (they are) also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}).
For if {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} are not the least of those (numbers) having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (respectively), then there will be [some] numbers less than {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} which are in the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (respectively).
Let them be {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {L magnitude}.
Thus, {H magnitude} measures {A magnitude} the same number of times that {K magnitude}, {L magnitude} also measure {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, respectively.
And as many times as {H magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, so many units let there be in {M magnitude}.
Thus, {K magnitude}, {L magnitude} measure {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, respectively, according to the units in {M magnitude}.
And since {H magnitude} measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {M magnitude}, {M magnitude} thus also measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {H magnitude} [Prop. 7.15].
So, for the same (reasons), {M magnitude} also measures {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} according to the units in {K magnitude}, {L magnitude}, respectively.
Thus, {M magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
And since {H magnitude} measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {M magnitude}, {H magnitude} has thus made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {M magnitude}.
So, for the same (reasons), {E magnitude} has also made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {E magnitude} and {D magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {H magnitude} and {M magnitude}.
Thus, as {E magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}, so {M magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
And {E magnitude} (is) greater than {H magnitude}.
Thus, {M magnitude} (is) also greater than {D magnitude} [Prop. 5.13].
And ({M magnitude} ) measures {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
The very thing is impossible.
For {D magnitude} was assumed (to be) the greatest common measure of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
Thus, there cannot be any numbers less than {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} which are in the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} are the least of (those numbers) having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (respectively).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
