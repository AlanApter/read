To cut off a prescribed part from a given straight-line.

Let {AB line} be the given straight-line.
So it is required to cut off a prescribed part from {AB line}.

So let a third (part) have been prescribed.
[And] let some straight-line {AC line} have been drawn from (point) {A point}, encompassing a random angle with {AB line}.
And let a random point {D point} have been taken on {AC line}.
And let {DE line} and {EC line} be made equal to {AD line} [Prop. 1.3].
And let {BC line} have been joined.
And let {DF line} have been drawn through {D point} parallel to it [Prop. 1.31].

Therefore, since {FD line} has been drawn parallel to one of the sides, {BC line}, of triangle {ABC polygon}, then, proportionally, as {CD line} is to {DA line}, so {BF line} (is) to {FA line} [Prop. 6.2].
And {CD line} (is) double {DA line}.
Thus, {BF line} (is) also double {FA line}.
Thus, {BA line} (is) triple {AF line}.

Thus, the prescribed third part, {AF line}, has been cut off from the given straight-line, {AB line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
