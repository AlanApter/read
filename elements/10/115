An infinite (series) of irrational (straight-lines) can be created from a medial (straight-line), and none of them is the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).

Let A be a medial (straight-line).
I say that an infinite (series) of irrational (straight-lines) can be created from A, and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).

Let the rational (straight-line) B be laid down.
And let the (square) on C be equal to the (rectangle contained) by B and A.
Thus, C is irrational [Def. 10.4].
For an (area contained) by an irrational and a rational (straight-line) is irrational [Prop. 10.20].
And (C is) not the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).
For the (square) on none of the preceding (straight-lines), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a medial (straight-line) as breadth.
So, again, let the (square) on D be equal to the (rectangle contained) by B and C.
Thus, the (square) on D is irrational [Prop. 10.20].
D is thus irrational [Def. 10.4].
And (D is) not the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).
For the (square) on none of the preceding (straight-lines), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces C as breadth.
So, similarly, this arrangement being advanced to infinity, it is clear that an infinite (series) of irrational (straight-lines) can be created from a medial (straight-line), and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
