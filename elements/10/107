A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with a (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole is itself also a (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.

Let AB be a (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole, and let CD be commensurable (in length) with AB.
I say that CD is also a (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.

For let BE be an attachment to AB.
And let the same construction have been made (as in the previous propositions).
Thus, AE and EB are (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial, and, further, the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by them [Prop. 10.78].
And, as was shown (previously), AE and EB are commensurable (in length) with CF and FD (respectively), and the sum of the squares on AE and EB with the sum of the squares on CF and FD, and the (rectangle contained) by AE and EB with the (rectangle contained) by CF and FD.
Thus, CF and FD are also (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial, and, further, the sum of the [squares] on them incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by them.

Thus, CD is a (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole [Prop. 10.78].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
