11. Given a rational (straight-line) and an apotome, if the square on the whole is greater than the (square on a straight-line) attached (to the apotome) by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with (the whole), and the whole is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), then let the (apotome) be called a first apotome.

12. And if the attached (straight-line) is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), and the square on the whole is greater than (the square on) the attached (straight-line) by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (the whole), then let the (apotome) be called a second apotome.

13. And if neither of (the whole or the attached straight-line) is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), and the square on the whole is greater than (the square on) the attached (straight-line) by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (the whole), then let the (apotome) be called a third apotome.

14. Again, if the square on the whole is greater than (the square on) the attached (straight-line) by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable [in length] with (the whole), and the whole is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), then let the (apotome) be called a fourth apotome.

15. And if the attached (straight-line is commensurable), a fifth (apotome).

16. And if neither (the whole nor the attached straight-line is commensurable), a sixth (apotome).
