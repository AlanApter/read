 The rectangle contained by rational straight-lines (which are) commensurable in square only is irrational, and its square-root is irrational---let it be called medial.

For let the rectangle {AC polygon} be contained by the rational straight-lines {AB line} and {BC line} (which are) commensurable in square only.
I say that {AC polygon} is irrational, and its square-root is irrational---let it be called medial.

For let the square {AD polygon} have been described on {AB line}.
{AD polygon} is thus rational [Def. 10.4].
And since {AB line} is incommensurable in length with {BC line}.
For they were assumed to be commensurable in square only.
And {AB line} (is) equal to {BD line}.
{DB line} is thus also incommensurable in length with {BC line}.
And as {DB line} is to {BC line}, so {AD polygon} (is) to {AC polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {DA polygon} [is] incommensurable with {AC polygon} [Prop. 10.11].
And {DA polygon} (is) rational.
Thus, {AC polygon} is irrational [Def. 10.4].
Hence, its square-root [that is to say, the square-root of the square equal to it] is also irrational [Def. 10.4]---let it be called medial.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
