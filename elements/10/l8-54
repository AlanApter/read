 Let AB and BC be two squares, and let them be laid down such that DB is straight-on to BE.
 FB is, thus, also straight-on to BG.
 And let the parallelogram AC have been completed.
 I say that AC is a square, and that DG is the mean proportional to AB and BC, and, moreover, DC is the mean proportional to AC and CB.

For since DB is equal to BF, and BE to BG, the whole of DE is thus equal to the whole of FG.
But DE is equal to each of AH and KC, and FG is equal to each of AK and HC [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, AH and KC are also equal to AK and HC, respectively.
Thus, the parallelogram AC is equilateral.
And (it is) also right-angled.
Thus, AC is a square.

And since as FB is to BG, so DB (is) to BE, but as FB (is) to BG, so AB (is) to DG, and as DB (is) to BE, so DG (is) to BC [Prop.
6.1], thus also as AB (is) to DG, so DG (is) to BC [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, DG is the mean proportional to AB and BC.

So I also say that DC [is] the mean proportional to AC and CB.

For since as AD is to DK, so KG (is) to GC.
For [they are] respectively equal.
And, via composition, as AK (is) to KD, so KC (is) to CG [Prop. 5.18].
But as AK (is) to KD, so AC (is) to CD, and as KC (is) to CG, so DC (is) to CB [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, also, as AC (is) to DC, so DC (is) to BC [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, DC is the mean proportional to AC and CB.
Which (is the very thing) it was prescribed to show.
