If two magnitudes do not have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number then the magnitudes will be incommensurable.

For let the two magnitudes {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} not have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.
I say that the magnitudes {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are incommensurable.

For if they are commensurable, {A magnitude} will have to {B magnitude} the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5].
But it does not have (such a ratio).
Thus, the magnitudes {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are incommensurable.

Thus, if two magnitudes ... to one another, and so on ....
