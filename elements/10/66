A (straight-line) commensurable in length with a binomial (straight-line) is itself also binomial, and the same in order.

Let AB be a binomial (straight-line), and let CD be commensurable in length with AB.
I say that CD is a binomial (straight-line), and (is) the same in order as AB.

For since AB is a binomial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at E, and let AE be the greater term.
AE and EB are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.36].
Let it have been contrived that as AB (is) to CD, so AE (is) to CF [Prop. 6.12].
Thus, the remainder EB is also to the remainder FD, as AB (is) to CD [Props. 6.16, 5.19 corr.].
And AB (is) commensurable in length with CD.
Thus, AE is also commensurable (in length) with CF, and EB with FD [Prop. 10.11].
And AE and EB are rational.
Thus, CF and FD are also rational.
And as AE is to CF, (so) EB (is) to FD [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, alternately, as AE is to EB, (so) CF (is) to FD [Prop. 5.16].
And AE and EB [are] commensurable in square only.
Thus, CF and FD are also commensurable in square only [Prop.
10.11].
And they are rational.
CD is thus a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that it is the same in order as AB.

For the square on AE is greater than (the square on) EB by the (square) on (some straight-line) either commensurable or incommensurable (in length) with (AE).
Therefore, if the square on AE is greater than (the square on) EB by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (AE) then the square on CF will also be greater than (the square on) FD by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (CF) [Prop. 10.14].
And if AE is commensurable (in length) with (some previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then CF will also be commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.12].
And, on account of this, AB and CD are each first binomial (straight-lines) [Def. 10.5]---that is to say, the same in order.
And if EB is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then FD is also commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.12], and, again, on account of this, (CD) will be the same in order as AB.
For each of them will be second binomial (straight-lines) [Def. 10.6].
And if neither of AE and EB is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then neither of CF and FD will be commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.13], and each (of AB and CD) is a third (binomial straight-line) [Def. 10.7].
And if the square on AE is greater than (the square on) EB by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (AE) then the square on CF is also greater than (the square on) FD by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (CF) [Prop. 10.14].
And if AE is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then CF is also commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.12], and each (of AB and CD) is a fourth (binomial straight-line) [Def. 10.8].
And if EB (is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straight-line) then FD (is) also (commensurable in length with it), and each (of AB and CD) will be a fifth (binomial straight-line) [Def. 10.9].
And if neither of AE and EB (is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straight-line) then also neither of CF and FD is commensurable (in length) with the laid down rational (straight-line), and each (of AB and CD) will be a sixth (binomial straight-line) [Def.
10.10].

Hence, a (straight-line) commensurable in length with a binomial (straight-line) is a binomial (straight-line), and the same in order.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
