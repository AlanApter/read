Similar solid numbers have to one another the ratio which (some) cube number (has) to a(nother) cube number.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be similar solid numbers.
I say that {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} the ratio which (some) cube number (has) to a(nother) cube number.

For since {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar solid (numbers), two numbers thus fall (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.19].
Let {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} have (so) fallen.
And let the least numbers, {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, {H magnitude}, having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {B magnitude}, (and) equal in multitude to them, have been taken [Prop. 8.2].
Thus, the outermost of them, {E magnitude} and {H magnitude}, are cube [Prop. 8.2 corr.].
And as {E magnitude} is to {H magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
And thus {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} the ratio which (some) cube number (has) to a(nother) cube number.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
