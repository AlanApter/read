Plane numbers have to one another the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) their sides.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be plane numbers, and let the numbers {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} be the sides of {A magnitude}, and (the numbers) {E magnitude}, {F magnitude} (the sides) of {B magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) their sides.

For given the ratios which {C magnitude} has to {E magnitude}, and {D magnitude} (has) to {F magnitude}, let the least numbers, {G magnitude}, {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, continuously proportional in the ratios {C magnitude} {E magnitude}, {D magnitude} {F magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 8.4], so that as {C magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {G magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude} , and as {D magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude}.
And let {D magnitude} make {L magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}.

And since {D magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}, and has made {L magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}, thus as {C magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And as {C magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {G magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}.
And thus as {G magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}.
Again, since {E magnitude} has made {L magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.16], but, in fact, has also made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}, thus as {D magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {L magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
But, as {D magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude}.
And thus as {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude}, so {L magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
And it was also shown that as {G magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}.
Thus, via equality, as {G magnitude} is to {K magnitude}, [so] {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.14].
And {G magnitude} has to {K magnitude} the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}).
Thus, {A magnitude} also has to {B magnitude} the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
