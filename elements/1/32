For any triangle, (if) one of the sides (is) produced (then) the external angle is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite (angles), and the (sum of the) three internal angles of the triangle is equal to two right-angles.

Let {ABC polygon} be a triangle, and let one of its sides {BC line} have been produced to {D point}.
I say that the external angle {ACD angle} is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite angles {CAB angle} and {ABC angle}, and the (sum of the) three internal angles of the triangle ---{ABC angle}, {BCA angle}, and {CAB angle}--- is equal to two right-angles.

For let {CE line} have been drawn through point {C point} parallel to the straight-line {AB line} [Prop. 1.31].

And since {AB line} is parallel to {CE line}, and {AC line} has fallen across them, the alternate angles {BAC angle} and {ACE angle} are equal to one another [Prop. 1.29].
Again, since {AB line} is parallel to {CE line}, and the straight-line {BD line} has fallen across them, the external angle {ECD angle} is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) {ABC angle} [Prop. 1.29].
But {ACE angle} was also shown (to be) equal to {BAC angle}.
Thus, the whole angle {ACD angle} is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite (angles) {BAC angle} and {ABC angle}.

Let {ACB angle} have been added to both.
Thus, (the sum of) {ACD angle} and {ACB angle} is equal to the (sum of the) three (angles) {ABC angle}, {BCA angle}, and {CAB angle}.
But, (the sum of) {ACD angle} and {ACB angle} is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
Thus, (the sum of) {ACB angle}, {CBA angle}, and {CAB angle} is also equal to two right-angles.

Thus, for any triangle, (if) one of the sides (is) produced (then) the external angle is equal to the (sum of the) two internal and opposite (angles), and the (sum of the) three internal angles of the triangle is equal to two right-angles.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
