If a parallelogram has the same base as a triangle, and is between the same parallels, then the parallelogram is double (the area) of the triangle.

For let parallelogram {ABCD polygon} have the same base {BC line} as triangle {EBC polygon}, and let it be between the same parallels, {BC line} and {AE line}.
I say that parallelogram {ABCD polygon} is double (the area) of triangle {BEC polygon}.

For let {AC line} have been joined.
So triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {EBC polygon}.
For it is on the same base, {BC line}, as ({EBC polygon}), and between the same parallels, {BC line} and {AE line} [Prop. 1.37].
But, parallelogram {ABCD polygon} is double (the area) of triangle {ABC polygon}.
For the diagonal {AC line} cuts the former in half [Prop. 1.34].
So parallelogram {ABCD polygon} is also double (the area) of triangle {EBC polygon}.

Thus, if a parallelogram has the same base as a triangle, and is between the same parallels, then the parallelogram is double (the area) of the triangle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
