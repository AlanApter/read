If an even (number) is subtracted from an(other) even number then the remainder will be even.

For let the even (number) {BC magnitude} have been subtracted from the even number {AB magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {CA magnitude} is even.

For since {AB magnitude} is even, it has a half part [Def. 7.6].
So, for the same (reasons), {BC magnitude} also has a half part.
And hence the remainder [{CA magnitude} has a half part].
[Thus,] {AC magnitude} is even.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
