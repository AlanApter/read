If some straight-line touches a circle, and some (other) straight-line is drawn across, from the point of contact into the circle, cutting the circle (in two), then those angles the (straight-line) makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle.

For let some straight-line {EF line} touch the circle {ABCD circle T} at the point {B point}, and let some (other) straight-line {BD line} have been drawn from point {B point} into the circle {ABCD circle T}, cutting it (in two).
I say that the angles {BD line} makes with the tangent {EF line} will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle.
That is to say, that angle {FBD angle} is equal to the angle constructed in segment {BAD arc T}, and angle {EBD angle} is equal to the angle constructed in segment {DCB arc T}.

For let {BA line} have been drawn from {B point}, at right-angles to {EF line} [Prop. 1.11].
And let the point {C point} have been taken at random on the circumference {BD arcc T}.
And let {AD line}, {DC line}, and {CB line} have been joined.

And since some straight-line {EF line} touches the circle {ABCD circle T} at point {B point}, and {BA line} has been drawn from the point of contact, at right-angles to the tangent, the center of circle {ABCD circle T} is thus on {BA line} [Prop. 3.19].
Thus, {BA line} is a diameter of circle {ABCD circle T}.
Thus, angle {ADB angle}, being in a semi-circle, is a right-angle [Prop. 3.31].
Thus, the remaining angles (of triangle {ADB polygon}) {BAD angle} and {ABD angle} are equal to one right-angle [Prop. 1.32].
And {ABF angle} is also a right-angle.
Thus, {ABF angle} is equal to {BAD angle} and {ABD angle}.
Let {ABD angle} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remaining angle {DBF angle} is equal to the angle {BAD angle} in the alternate segment of the circle.
And since {ABCD polygon} is a quadrilateral in a circle, (the sum of) its opposite angles is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 3.22].
And {DBF angle} and {DBE angle} is also equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
Thus, {DBF angle} and {DBE angle} is equal to {BAD angle} and {BCD angle}, of which {BAD angle} was shown (to be) equal to {DBF angle}.
Thus, the remaining (angle) {DBE angle} is equal to the angle {DCB angle} in the alternate segment {DCB arc T} of the circle.

Thus, if some straight-line touches a circle, and some (other) straight-line is drawn across, from the point of contact into the circle, cutting the circle (in two), then those angles the (straight-line) makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
