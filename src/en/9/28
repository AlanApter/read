If an odd number makes some (number by) multiplying an even (number) then the created (number) will be even.

For let the odd number {A magnitude} make {C magnitude} (by) multiplying the even (number) {B magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} is even.

For since {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is thus composed out of so many (magnitudes) equal to {B magnitude}, as many as (there) are units in {A magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
And {B magnitude} is even.
Thus, {C magnitude} is composed out of even (numbers).
And if any multitude whatsoever of even numbers is added together then the whole is even [Prop. 9.21].
Thus, {C magnitude} is even.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
