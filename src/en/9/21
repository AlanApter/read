If any multitude whatsoever of even numbers is added together then the whole is even.

For let any multitude whatsoever of even numbers, {AB magnitude}, {BC magnitude}, {CD magnitude}, {DE magnitude}, lie together.
I say that the whole, {AE magnitude}, is even.

For since everyone of {AB magnitude}, {BC magnitude}, {CD magnitude}, {DE magnitude} is even, it has a half part [Def. 7.6].
And hence the whole {AE magnitude} has a half part.
And an even number is one (which can be) divided in half [Def. 7.6].
Thus, {AE magnitude} is even.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
