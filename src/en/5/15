Parts have the same ratio as similar multiples, taken in corresponding order.

For let {AB magnitude} and {DE magnitude} be equal multiples of {C magnitude} and {F magnitude} (respectively).
I say that as {C magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {AB magnitude} (is) to {DE magnitude}.

For since {AB magnitude} and {DE magnitude} are equal multiples of {C magnitude} and {F magnitude} (respectively), thus as many magnitudes as there are in {AB magnitude} equal to {C magnitude}, so many (are there) also in {DE magnitude} equal to {F magnitude}.
Let {AB magnitude} have been divided into (magnitudes) {AG magnitude}, {GH magnitude}, {HB magnitude}, equal to {C magnitude}, and {DE magnitude} into (magnitudes) {DK magnitude}, {KL magnitude}, {LE magnitude}, equal to {F magnitude}.
So, the number of (magnitudes) {AG magnitude}, {GH magnitude}, {HB magnitude} will equal the number of (magnitudes) {DK magnitude}, {KL magnitude}, {LE magnitude}.
And since {AG magnitude}, {GH magnitude}, {HB magnitude} are equal to one another, and {DK magnitude}, {KL magnitude}, {LE magnitude} are also equal to one another, thus as {AG magnitude} is to {DK magnitude}, so {GH magnitude} (is) to {KL magnitude}, and {HB magnitude} to {LE magnitude} [Prop. 5.7].
And, thus (for proportional magnitudes), as one of the leading (magnitudes) will be to one of the following, so all of the leading (magnitudes will be) to all of the following [Prop. 5.12].
Thus, as {AG magnitude} is to {DK magnitude}, so {AB magnitude} (is)to {DE magnitude}.
And {AG magnitude} is equal to {C magnitude}, and {DK magnitude} to {F magnitude}.
Thus, as {C magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {AB magnitude} (is) to {DE magnitude}.

Thus, parts have the same ratio as similar multiples, taken in corresponding order.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
