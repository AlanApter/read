If from a parallelogram a(nother) parallelogram is subtracted (which is) similar, and similarly laid out, to the whole, having a common angle with it, then (the subtracted parallelogram) is about the same diagonal as the whole.

For, from parallelogram {ABCD polygon}, let (parallelogram) {AF polygon} have been subtracted (which is) similar, and similarly laid out, to {ABCD polygon}, having the common angle {DAB angle} with it.
I say that {ABCD polygon} is about the same diagonal as {AF polygon}.

For (if) not, then, if possible, let {AHC given} be [{ABCD polygon}'s] diagonal.
And producing {GF line}, let it have been drawn through to (point) {H point} (as {GH line}).
And let {HK line} have been drawn through (point) {H point}, parallel to either of {AD line} or {BC line} [Prop. 1.31].

Therefore, since {ABCD polygon} is about the same diagonal as {KG polygon}, thus as {DA line} is to {AB line}, so {GA line} (is) to {AK line} [Prop. 6.24].
And, on account of the similarity of {ABCD polygon} and {EG polygon}, also, as {DA line} (is) to {AB line}, so {GA line} (is) to {AE line}.
Thus, also, as {GA line} (is) to {AK line}, so {GA line} (is) to {AE line}.
Thus, {GA line} has the same ratio to each of {AK line} and {AE line}.
Thus, {AE line} is equal to {AK line} [Prop. 5.9], the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {ABCD polygon} is not not about the same diagonal as {AF polygon}.
Thus, parallelogram {ABCD polygon} is about the same diagonal as parallelogram {AF polygon}.

Thus, if from a parallelogram a(nother) parallelogram is subtracted (which is) similar, and similarly laid out, to the whole, having a common angle with it, then (the subtracted parallelogram) is about the same diagonal as the whole.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
