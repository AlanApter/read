If a number has any part whatever then it will be measured by a number called the same as the part.

For let the number {A magnitude} have any part whatever, {B magnitude}.
And let the [number] {C magnitude} be called the same as the part {B magnitude} (i.e., {B magnitude} is the {C magnitude}th part of {A magnitude}).
I say that {C magnitude} measures {A magnitude}.

For since {B magnitude} is a part of {A magnitude} called the same as {C magnitude}, and the unit {D magnitude} is also a part of {C magnitude} called the same as it (i.e., {D magnitude} is the {C magnitude}th part of {C magnitude}), thus which(ever) part the unit {D magnitude} is of the number {C magnitude}, {B magnitude} is also the same part of {A magnitude}.
Thus, the unit {D magnitude} measures the number {C magnitude} as many times as {B magnitude} (measures) {A magnitude}.
Thus, alternately, the unit {D magnitude} measures the number {B magnitude} as many times as {C magnitude} (measures) {A magnitude} [Prop. 7.15].
Thus, {C magnitude} measures {A magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
