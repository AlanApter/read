For any triangle, (the sum of any) two sides is greater than the remaining (side), (the sides) being taken up in any (possible way).

For let {ABC polygon} be a triangle.
I say that for triangle {ABC polygon} (the sum of any) two sides is greater than the remaining (side), (the sides) being taken up in any (possible way).
(So), (the sum of) {BA line} and {AC line} (is greater) than {BC line}, (the sum of) {AB line} and {BC line} than {AC line}, and (the sum of) {BC line} and {CA line} than {AB line}.

For let {BA line} have been drawn through to point {D point} (as {AD line}), and let {AD line} be made equal to {CA line} [Prop. 1.3], and let {DC line} have been joined.

Therefore, since {DA line} is equal to {AC line}, the angle {ADC angle} is also equal to {ACD angle} [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, {BCD angle} is greater than {ADC angle}.
And since triangle {DCB polygon} has the angle {BCD angle} greater than {BDC angle}, and the greater angle subtends the greater side [Prop. 1.19], {DB line} is thus greater than {BC line}.
But {DA line} is equal to {AC line}.
Thus, (the sum of) {BA line} and {AC line} is greater than {BC line}.
Similarly, we can show that (the sum of) {AB line} and {BC line} is also greater than {CA line}, and (the sum of) {BC line} and {CA line} than {AB line}.

Thus, for any triangle, (the sum of any) two sides is greater than the remaining (side), (the sides) being taken up in any (possible way).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
