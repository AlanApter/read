To describe a square on a given straight-line.

Let {AB line} be the given straight-line.
So it is required to describe a square on the straight-line {AB line}.

Let {AC line} have been drawn at right-angles to the straight-line {AB line} from the point {A point} on it [Prop. 1.11], and let {AD line} have been made equal to {AB line} [Prop. 1.3].
And let {DE line} have been drawn through point {D point} parallel to {AB line} [Prop. 1.31], and let {BE line} have been drawn through point {B point} parallel to {AD line} [Prop. 1.31].
Thus, {ADEB polygon} is a parallelogram.
Thus, {AB line} is equal to {DE line}, and {AD line} to {BE line} [Prop. 1.34].
But, {AB line} is equal to {AD line}.
Thus, the four (sides) {BA line}, {AD line}, {DE line}, and {EB line} are equal to one another.
Thus, the parallelogram {ADEB polygon} is equilateral.
So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
For since the straight-line {AD line} falls across the parallel-lines {AB line} and {DE line}, the (sum of the) angles {BAD angle} and {ADE angle} is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
But {BAD angle} (is a) right-angle.
Thus, {ADE angle} (is) also a right-angle.
And for parallelogrammic figures, the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, each of the opposite angles {ABE angle} and {BED angle} (are) also right-angles.
Thus, {ADEB polygon} is right-angled.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.

Thus, ({ADEB polygon}) is a square [Def. 1.22].
And it is described on the straight-line {AB line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
