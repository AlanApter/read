To draw a straight-line parallel to a given straight-line, through a given point.

Let {A point} be the given point, and {BC line} the given straight-line.
So it is required to draw a straight-line parallel to the straight-line {BC line}, through the point {A point}.

Let the point {D point} have been taken somewhere on {BC line}, and let {AD line} have been joined.
And let (angle) {DAE angle}, equal to angle {ADC angle}, have been constructed at the point {A point} on the straight-line {DA line} [Prop. 1.23].
And let the straight-line {AF line} have been produced in a straight-line with {EA line}.

And since the straight-line {AD line}, (in) falling across the two straight-lines {BC line} and {EF line}, has made the alternate angles {EAD angle} and {ADC angle} equal to one another, {EF line} is thus parallel to {BC line} [Prop. 1.27].

Thus, the straight-line {EF line} has been drawn parallel to the given straight-line {BC line}, through the given point {A point}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
