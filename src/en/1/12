To draw a straight-line perpendicular to a given infinite straight-line from a given point which is not on it.

Let {AB line} be the given infinite straight-line and {C point} the given point, which is not on ({AB line}).
So it is required to draw a straight-line perpendicular to the given infinite straight-line {AB line} from the given point {C point}, which is not on ({AB line}).

For let point {D point} have been taken somewhere on the other side (to {C point}) of the straight-line {AB line}, and let the circle {EFG circle C} have been drawn with center {C point} and radius {CD line} [Post. 3], and let the straight-line {EG line} have been cut in half at (point) {H point} [Prop. 1.10], and let the straight-lines {CG line}, {CH line}, and {CE line} have been joined.
I say that a (straight-line) {CH line} has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight-line {AB line} from the given point {C point}, which is not on ({AB line}).

For since {GH line} is equal to {HE line}, and {HC line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {GH line}, {HC line} are equal to the two straight-lines {EH line}, {HC line}, respectively, and the base {CG line} is equal to the base {CE line}.
Thus, the angle {CHG angle} is equal to the angle {EHC angle} [Prop. 1.8], and they are adjacent.
But when a straight-line stood on a(nother) straight-line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is a right-angle, and the former straight-line is called perpendicular to that upon which it stands [Def. 1.10].

Thus, the (straight-line) {CH line} has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight-line {AB line} from the given point {C point}, which is not on ({AB line}).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
