To cut a given circumference in half.

Let {ADB arc C} be the given circumference.
So it is required to cut circumference {ADB arc C} in half.

Let {AB line} have been joined, and let it have been cut in half at (point) {C point} [Prop. 1.10].
And let {CD line} have been drawn from point {C point}, at right-angles to {AB line} [Prop. 1.11].
And let {AD line}, and {DB line} have been joined.

And since {AC line} is equal to {CB line}, and {CD line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AC line}, {CD line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BC line}, {CD line} (respectively).
And angle {ACD angle} (is) equal to angle {BCD angle}.
For (they are) each right-angles.
Thus, the base {AD line} is equal to the base {DB line} [Prop. 1.4].
And equal straight-lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater (circumference being equal) to the greater, and the lesser to the lesser [Prop. 1.28].
And the circumferences {AD arc C} and {DB arc C} are each less than a semi-circle.
Thus, circumference {AD arc C} (is) equal to circumference {DB arc C}.

Thus, the given circumference has been cut in half at point {D point}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
