If there are any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers, and the first does not measure the second, then no other (number) will measure any other (number) either.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} be any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers, and let {A magnitude} not measure {B magnitude}.
I say that no other (number) will measure any other (number) either.

Now, (it is) clear that {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} do not successively measure one another.
For {A magnitude} does not even measure {B magnitude}.
So I say that no other (number) will measure any other (number) either.
For, if possible, let {A magnitude} measure {C magnitude}.
And as many (numbers) as are {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, let so many of the least numbers, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, {H magnitude}, have been taken of those (numbers) having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} [Prop. 7.33].
And since {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, {H magnitude} are in the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, and the multitude of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is equal to the multitude of {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, {H magnitude}, thus, via equality, as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude} [Prop. 7.14].
And since as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, and {A magnitude} does not measure {B magnitude}, {F magnitude} does not measure {G magnitude} either [Def. 7.20].
Thus, {F magnitude} is not a unit.
For a unit measures all numbers.
And {F magnitude} and {H magnitude} are prime to one another [Prop. 8.3] [and thus {F magnitude} does not measure {H magnitude}].
And as {F magnitude} is to {H magnitude},so {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}.
And thus {A magnitude} does not measure {C magnitude} either [Def. 7.20].
So, similarly, we can show that no other (number) can measure any other (number) either.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
