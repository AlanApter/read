Two numbers fall (between) two similar solid numbers in mean proportion.
And a solid (number) has to a similar solid (number) a cubed ratio with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be two similar solid numbers, and let {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} be the sides of {A magnitude}, and {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, {H magnitude} (the sides) of {B magnitude}.
And since similar solid (numbers) are those having proportional sides [Def. 7.21], thus as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, and as {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {G magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}.
I say that two numbers fall (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion, and (that) {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and, further, {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}.

For let {C magnitude} make {K magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}, and let {F magnitude} make {L magnitude} (by) multiplying {G magnitude}.
And since {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} are in the same ratio as {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, and {K magnitude} is the (number created) from (multiplying) {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, and {L magnitude} the (number created) from (multiplying) {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, [thus] {K magnitude} and {L magnitude} are similar plane numbers [Def. 7.21].
Thus, there exits one number in mean proportion to {K magnitude} and {L magnitude} [Prop. 8.18].
Let it be {M magnitude}.
Thus, {M magnitude} is the (number created) from (multiplying) {D magnitude}, {F magnitude}, as shown in the theorem before this (one).
And since {D magnitude} has made {K magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}, and has made {M magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}, thus as {C magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {K magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
But, as {K magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude}, (so) {M magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}.
Thus, {K magnitude}, {M magnitude}, {L magnitude} are continuously proportional in the ratio of {C magnitude} to {F magnitude}.
And since as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, thus, alternately, as {C magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 7.13].
And so, for the same (reasons), as {D magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}.
Thus, {K magnitude}, {M magnitude}, {L magnitude} are continuously proportional in the ratio of {C magnitude} to {F magnitude}, and of {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and, further, of {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}.
So let {E magnitude}, {H magnitude} make {N magnitude}, {O magnitude}, respectively, (by) multiplying {M magnitude}.
And since {A magnitude} is solid, and {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} are its sides, {E magnitude} has thus made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying the (number created) from (multiplying) {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
And {K magnitude} is the (number created) from (multiplying) {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {K magnitude}.
And so, for the same (reasons), {H magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {L magnitude}.
And since {E magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {K magnitude}, but has, in fact, also made {N magnitude} (by) multiplying {M magnitude}, thus as {K magnitude} is to {M magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {N magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And as {K magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and, further, {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}.
And thus as {C magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {N magnitude}.
Again, since {E magnitude}, {H magnitude} have made {N magnitude}, {O magnitude}, respectively, (by) multiplying {M magnitude}, thus as {E magnitude} is to {H magnitude}, so {N magnitude} (is) to {O magnitude} [Prop. 7.18].
But, as {E magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}.
And thus as {C magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}, so (is) {A magnitude} to {N magnitude}, and {N magnitude} to {O magnitude}.
Again, since {H magnitude} has made {O magnitude} (by) multiplying {M magnitude}, but has, in fact, also made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {L magnitude}, thus as {M magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, so {O magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
But, as {M magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}.
And thus as {C magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}, so not only (is) {O magnitude} to {B magnitude}, but also {A magnitude} to {N magnitude}, and {N magnitude} to {O magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude}, {N magnitude}, {O magnitude}, {B magnitude} are continuously proportional in the aforementioned ratios of the sides.

So I say that {A magnitude} also has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side---that is to say, with respect to (that) the number {C magnitude} (has) to {F magnitude}, or {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and, further, {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}.
For since {A magnitude}, {N magnitude}, {O magnitude}, {B magnitude} are four continuously proportional numbers, {A magnitude} thus has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) {A magnitude} (has) to {N magnitude} [Def. 5.10].
But, as {A magnitude} (is) to {N magnitude}, so it was shown (is) {C magnitude} to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and, further, {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}.
And thus {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side---that is to say, with respect to (that) the number {C magnitude} (has) to {F magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {G magnitude}, and, further, {E magnitude} to {H magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
