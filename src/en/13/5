If a straight-line is cut in extreme and mean ratio, and a (straight-line) equal to the greater piece is added to it, then the whole straight-line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and the original straight-line is the greater piece.

For let the straight-line {AB line} have been cut in extreme and mean ratio at point {C point}.
And let {AC line} be the greater piece.
And let {AD line} be [made] equal to {AC line}.
I say that the straight-line {DB line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {A point}, and that the original straight-line {AB line} is the greater piece.

For let the square {AE polygon} have been described on {AB line}, and let the (remainder of the) figure have been drawn.
And since {AB line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {C point}, the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line} is thus equal to the (square) on {AC line} [Def. 6.3, Prop. 6.17].
And {CE polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line}, and {CH polygon} the (square) on {AC line}.
But, {HE polygon} is equal to {CE polygon} [Prop. 1.43], and {DH polygon} equal to {HC polygon}.
Thus, {DH polygon} is also equal to {HE polygon}.
[Let {HB polygon} have been added to both.]
Thus, the whole of {DK polygon} is equal to the whole of {AE polygon}.
And {DK polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {BD line} and {DA line}.
For {AD line} (is) equal to {DL line}.
And {AE polygon} (is) the (square) on {AB line}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {BD line} and {DA line} is equal to the (square) on {AB line}.
Thus, as {DB line} (is) to {BA line}, so {BA line} (is) to {AD line} [Prop. 6.17].
And {DB line} (is) greater than {BA line}.
Thus, {BA line} (is) also greater than {AD line} [Prop. 5.14].

Thus, {DB line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {A point}, and the greater piece is {AB line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
