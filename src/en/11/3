If two planes cut one another then their common section is a straight-line.

For let the two planes {AB polygon} and {BC polygon} cut one another, and let their common section be the line {DB line}.
I say that the line {DB line} is straight.

For, if not, let the straight-line {DEB given} have been joined from {D point} to {B point} in the plane {AB polygon}, and the straight-line {DFB given} in the plane {BC polygon}.
So two straight-lines, {DEB given} and {DFB given}, will have the same ends, and they will clearly enclose an area.
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, {DEB given} and {DFB given} are not straight-lines.
So, similarly, we can show than no other straight-line can be joined from {D point} to {B point} except {DB line}, the common section of the planes {AB polygon} and {BC polygon}.

Thus, if two planes cut one another then their common section is a straight-line.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
