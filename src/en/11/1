Some part of a straight-line cannot be in a reference plane, and some part in a more elevated (plane).
For, if possible, let some part, {AB line}, of the straight-line {ABC line} be in a reference plane, and some part, {BC line}, in a more elevated (plane).

In the reference plane, there will be some straight-line continuous with, and straight-on to, {AB line}.
Let it be {BD line}.
Thus, {AB line} is a common segment of the two (different) straight-lines {ABC line} and {ABD line}.
The very thing is impossible, inasmuch as if we draw a circle with center {B point} and radius {AB line} then the diameters ({ABD line} and {ABC line}) will cut off unequal circumferences of the circle.

Thus, some part of a straight-line cannot be in a reference plane, and (some part) in a more elevated (plane).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
