And we can demonstrate, thusly, in which manner to take the (square) on {OR line} equal to that (area) by which the (square) on {AB line} is greater than the (square) on {LO line}.
Let the straight-lines {AB line} and {LO line} be set out, and let {AB line} be greater, and let the semicircle {ACB arc D} have been drawn around it.
And let {AC line}, equal to the straight-line {LO line}, which is not greater than the diameter {AB line}, have been inserted into the semicircle {ACB arc D} [Prop. 4.1].
And let {CB line} have been joined.
Therefore, since the angle {ACB angle} is in the semicircle {ACB arc D}, {ACB angle} is thus a right-angle [Prop. 3.31].
Thus, the (square) on {AB line} is equal to the (sum of the) squares on {AC line} and {CB line} [Prop. 1.47].
Hence, the (square) on {AB line} is greater than the (square) on {AC line} by the (square) on {CB line}.
And {AC line} (is) equal to {LO line}.
Thus, the (square) on {AB line} is greater than the (square) on {LO line} by the (square) on {CB line}.
Therefore, if we take {OR line} equal to {BC line} then the (square) on {AB line} will be greater than the (square) on {LO line} by the (square) on {OR line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was prescribed to do.
