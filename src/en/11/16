If two parallel planes are cut by some plane then their common sections are parallel.

For let the two parallel planes {AB polygon} and {CD polygon} have been cut by the plane {EFHG polygon}.
And let {EF line} and {GH line} be their common sections.
I say that {EF line} is parallel to {GH line}.

For, if not, being produced, {EF line} and {GH line} will meet either in the direction of {F point}, {H point}, or of {E point}, {G point}.
Let them be produced, as in the direction of {F point}, {H point}, and let them, first of all, have met at {K point}.
And since {EFK given} is in the plane {AB polygon}, all of the points on {EFK given} are thus also in the plane {AB polygon} [Prop. 11.1].
And {K point} is one of the points on {EFK given}.
Thus, {K point} is in the plane {AB polygon}.
So, for the same (reasons), {K point} is also in the plane {CD polygon}.
Thus, the planes {AB polygon} and {CD polygon}, being produced, will meet.
But they do not meet, on account of being (initially) assumed (to be mutually) parallel.
Thus, the straight-lines {EF line} and {GH line}, being produced in the direction of {F point}, {H point}, will not meet.
So, similarly, we can show that the straight-lines {EF line} and {GH line}, being produced in the direction of {E point}, {G point}, will not meet either.
And (straight-lines in one plane which), being produced, do not meet in either direction are parallel [Def. 1.23].
{EF line} is thus parallel to {GH line}.

Thus, if two parallel planes are cut by some plane then their common sections are parallel.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
