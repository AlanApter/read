The bases of equal parallelepiped solids are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
And those parallelepiped solids whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal.

Let {AB given} and {CD given} be equal parallelepiped solids.
I say that the bases of the parallelepiped solids {AB given} and {CD given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (so) as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so the height of solid {CD given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}.

{figure 1}For, first of all, let the (straight-lines) standing up, {AG line}, {EF line}, {LB line}, {HK line}, {CM line}, {NO line}, {PD line}, and {QR line}, be at right-angles to their bases.
I say that as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so {CM line} (is) to {AG line}.

Therefore, if base {EH polygon} is equal to base {NQ polygon}, and solid {AB given} is also equal to solid {CD given}, {CM line} will also be equal to {AG line}.
For parallelepiped solids of the same height are to one another as their bases [Prop. 11.32].
And as base {EH polygon} (is) to {NQ polygon}, so {CM line} will be to {AG line}.
And (so it is) clear that the bases of the parallelepiped solids {AB given} and {CD given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.

So let base {EH polygon} not be equal to base {NQ polygon}, but let {EH polygon} be greater.
And solid {AB given} is also equal to solid {CD given}.
Thus, {CM line} is also greater than {AG line}.
Therefore, let {CT line} be made equal to {AG line}.
And let the parallelepiped solid {VC given} have been completed on the base {NQ polygon}, with height {CT line}.
And since solid {AB given} is equal to solid {CD given}, and {CV given} (is) extrinsic (to them), and equal (magnitudes) have the same ratio to the same (magnitude) [Prop. 5.7], thus as solid {AB given} is to solid {CV given}, so solid {CD given} (is) to solid {CV given}.
But, as solid {AB given} (is) to solid {CV given}, so base {EH polygon} (is) to base {NQ polygon}.
For the solids {AB given} and {CV given} (are) of equal height [Prop. 11.32].
And as solid {CD given} (is) to solid {CV given}, so base {MQ polygon} (is) to base {TQ polygon} [Prop. 11.25], and {CM line} to {CT line} [Prop. 6.1].
And, thus, as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so {MC line} (is) to {AG line}.
And {CT line} (is) equal to {AG line}.
And thus as base {EH polygon} (is) to base {NQ polygon}, so {MC line} (is) to {AG line}.
Thus, the bases of the parallelepiped solids {AB given} and {CD given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.

So, again, let the bases of the parallelepipid solids {AB given} and {CD given} be reciprocally proportional to their heights, and let base {EH polygon} be to base {NQ polygon}, as the height of solid {CD given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}.
I say that solid {AB given} is equal to solid {CD given}.
[For] let the (straight-lines) standing up again be at right-angles to the bases.
And if base {EH polygon} is equal to base {NQ polygon}, and as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so the height of solid {CD given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}, the height of solid {CD given} is thus also equal to the height of solid {AB given}.
And parallelepiped solids on equal bases, and also with the same height, are equal to one another [Prop. 11.31].
Thus, solid {AB given} is equal to solid {CD given}.

So, let base {EH polygon} not be equal to [base] {NQ polygon}, but let {EH polygon} be greater.
Thus, the height of solid {CD given} is also greater than the height of solid {AB given}, that is to say {CM line} (greater) than {AG line}.
Let {CT line} again be made equal to {AG line}, and let the solid {CV given} have been similarly completed.
Since as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so {MC line} (is) to {AG line}, and {AG line} (is) equal to {CT line}, thus as base {EH polygon} (is) to base {NQ polygon}, so {CM line} (is) to {CT line}.
But, as [base] {EH polygon} (is) to base {NQ polygon}, so solid {AB given} (is) to solid {CV given}.
For solids {AB given} and {CV given} are of equal heights [Prop. 11.32].
And as {CM line} (is) to {CT line}, so (is) base {MQ polygon} to base {QT polygon} [Prop. 6.1], and solid {CD given} to solid {CV given} [Prop. 11.25].
And thus as solid {AB given} (is) to solid {CV given}, so solid {CD given} (is) to solid {CV given}.
Thus, {AB given} and {CD given} each have the same ratio to {CV given}.
Thus, solid {AB given} is equal to solid {CD given} [Prop. 5.9].

{figure 2}So, let the (straight-lines) standing up, {FE line}, {BL line}, {GA line}, {KH line}, {ON line}, {DP line}, {MC line}, and {RQ line}, not be at right-angles to their bases.
And let perpendiculars have been drawn to the planes through {EH polygon} and {NQ polygon} from points {F point}, {G point}, {B point}, {K point}, {O point}, {M point}, {R point}, and {D point}, and let them have joined the planes at (points) {S point}, {T point}, {U point}, {V point}, {W point}, {X point}, {Y point}, and {a point}(respectively).
And let the solids {FV given} and {OY given} have been completed.
In this case, also, I say that the solids {AB given} and {CD given} being equal, their bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (so) as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so the height of solid {CD given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}.

Since solid {AB given} is equal to solid {CD given}, but {AB given} is equal to {BT given}.
For they are on the same base {FK polygon}, and (have) the same height [Props. 11.29, 11.30].
And solid {CD given} is equal is equal to {DX given}.
For, again, they are on the same base {RO polygon}, and (have) the same height [Props. 11.29, 11.30].
Solid {BT given} is thus also equal to solid {DX given}.
Thus, as base {FK polygon} (is) to base {OR polygon}, so the height of solid {DX given} (is) to the height of solid {BT given} (see first part of proposition).
And base {FK polygon} (is) equal to base {EH polygon}, and base {OR polygon} to {NQ polygon}.
Thus, as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so the height of solid {DX given} (is) to the height of solid {BT given}.
And solids {DX given}, {BT given} are the same height as (solids) {DC given}, {BA given} (respectively).
Thus, as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so the height of solid {DC given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}.
Thus, the bases of the parallelepiped solids {AB given} and {CD given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.

So, again, let the bases of the parallelepiped solids {AB given} and {CD given} be reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (so) let base {EH polygon} be to base {NQ polygon}, as the height of solid {CD given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}.
I say that solid {AB given} is equal to solid {CD given}.

For, with the same construction (as before), since as base {EH polygon} is to base {NQ polygon}, so the height of solid {CD given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}, and base {EH polygon} (is) equal to base {FK polygon}, and {NQ polygon} to {OR polygon}, thus as base {FK polygon} is to base {OR polygon}, so the height of solid {CD given} (is) to the height of solid {AB given}.
And solids {AB given}, {CD given} are the same height as (solids) {BT given}, {DX given} (respectively).
Thus, as base {FK polygon} is to base {OR polygon}, so the height of solid {DX given} (is) to the height of solid {BT given}.
Thus, the bases of the parallelepiped solids {BT given} and {DX given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
Thus, solid {BT given} is equal to solid {DX given} (see first part of proposition).
But, {BT given} is equal to {BA given}.
For [they are] on the same base {FK polygon}, and (have) the same height [Props. 11.29, 11.30].
And solid {DX given} is equal to solid {DC given} [Props. 11.29, 11.30].
Thus, solid {AB given} is also equal to solid {CD given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
