If three straight-lines are (continuously) proportional then the parallelepiped solid (formed) from the three (straight-lines) is equal to the equilateral parallelepiped solid on the middle (straight-line which is) equiangular to the aforementioned (parallelepiped solid).

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} be three (continuously) proportional straight-lines, (such that) as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}.
I say that the (parallelepiped) solid (formed) from {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} is equal to the equilateral solid on {B magnitude} (which is) equiangular with the aforementioned (solid).

Let the solid angle at {E point}, contained by {DEG angle}, {GEF angle}, and {FED angle}, be set out.
And let {DE line}, {GE line}, and {EF line} each be made equal to {B magnitude}.
And let the parallelepiped solid {EK given} have been completed.
And (let) {LM line} (be made) equal to {A magnitude}.
And let the solid angle contained by {NLO angle}, {OLM angle}, and {MLN angle} have been constructed on the straight-line {LM line}, and at the point {L point} on it, (so as to be) equal to the solid angle {E point} [Prop. 11.23].
And let {LO line} be made equal to {B magnitude}, and {LN line} equal to {C magnitude}.
And since as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, and {A magnitude} (is) equal to {LM line}, and {B magnitude} to each of {LO line} and {ED line}, and {C magnitude} to {LN line}, thus as {LM line} (is) to {EF line}, so {DE line} (is) to {LN line}.
And (so) the sides around the equal angles {NLM angle} and {DEF angle} are reciprocally proportional.
Thus, parallelogram {MN polygon} is equal to parallelogram {DF polygon} [Prop. 6.14].
And since the two plane rectilinear angles {DEF angle} and {NLM angle} are equal, and the raised straight-lines stood on them (at their apexes), {LO line} and {EG line}, are equal to one another, and contain equal angles respectively with the original straight-lines (forming the angles), the perpendiculars drawn from points {G point} and {O point} to the planes through {NLM angle} and {DEF angle} (respectively) are thus equal to one another [Prop. 11.35 corr.].
Thus, the solids {LH given} and {EK given} (have) the same height.
And parallelepiped solids on equal bases, and with the same height, are equal to one another [Prop. 11.31].
Thus, solid {HL given} is equal to solid {EK given}.
And {LH given} is the solid (formed) from {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}, and {EK given} the solid on {B magnitude}.
Thus, the parallelepiped solid (formed) from {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} is equal to the equilateral solid on {B magnitude} (which is) equiangular with the aforementioned (solid).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
