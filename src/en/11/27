To describe a parallelepiped solid similar, and similarly laid out, to a given parallelepiped solid on a given straight-line.

Let the given straight-line be {AB line}, and the given parallelepiped solid {CD given}.
So, it is necessary to describe a parallelepiped solid similar, and similarly laid out, to the given parallelepiped solid {CD given} on the given straight-line {AB line}.

For, let a (solid angle) contained by the (plane angles) {BAH angle}, {HAK angle}, and {KAB angle} have been constructed, equal to solid angle at {C given}, on the straight-line {AB line} at the point {A point} on it [Prop. 11.26], such that angle {BAH angle} is equal to {ECF angle}, and {BAK angle} to {ECG angle}, and {KAH angle} to {GCF angle}.
And let it have been contrived that as {EC line} (is) to {CG line}, so {BA line} (is) to {AK line}, and as {GC line} (is) to {CF line}, so {KA line} (is) to {AH line} [Prop. 6.12].
And thus, via equality, as {EC line} is to {CF line}, so {BA line} (is) to {AH line} [Prop. 5.22].
And let the parallelogram {HB polygon} have been completed, and the solid {AL given}.

And since as {EC line} is to {CG line}, so {BA line} (is) to {AK line}, and the sides about the equal angles {ECG angle} and {BAK angle} are (thus) proportional, the parallelogram {GE polygon} is thus similar to the parallelogram {KB polygon}.
So, for the same (reasons), the parallelogram {KH polygon} is also similar to the parallelogram {GF polygon}, and, further, {FE polygon} (is similar) to {HB polygon}.
Thus, three of the parallelograms of solid {CD given} are similar to three of the parallelograms of solid {AL given}.
But, the (former) three are equal and similar to the three opposite, and the (latter) three are equal and similar to the three opposite.
Thus, the whole solid {CD given} is similar to the whole solid {AL given} [Def. 11.9].

Thus, {AL given}, similar, and similarly laid out, to the given parallelepiped solid {CD given}, has been described on the given straight-lines {AB line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
