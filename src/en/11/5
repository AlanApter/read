If a straight-line is set up at right-angles to three straight-lines cutting one another, at the common point of section, then the three straight-lines are in one plane.

For let some straight-line {AB line} have been set up at right-angles to three straight-lines {BC line}, {BD line}, and {BE line}, at the (common) point of section {B point}.
I say that {BC line}, {BD line}, and {BE line} are in one plane.

For (if) not, and if possible, let {BD line} and {BE line} be in the reference plane, and {BC line} in a more elevated (plane).
And let the plane through {AB line} and {BC line} have been produced.
So it will make a straight-line as a common section with the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
Let it make {BF line}.
Thus, the three straight-lines {AB line}, {BC line}, and {BF line} are in one planeâ€”(namely), that drawn through {AB line} and {BC line}.
And since {AB line} is at right-angles to each of {BD line} and {BE line}, {AB line} is thus also at right-angles to the plane (passing) through {BD line} and {BE line} [Prop. 11.4].
And the plane (passing) through {BD line} and {BE line} is the reference plane.
Thus, {AB line} is at right-angles to the reference plane.
Hence, {AB line} will also make right-angles with all straight-lines joined to it which are also in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
And {BF line}, which is in the reference plane, is joined to it.
Thus, the angle {ABF angle} is a right-angle.
And {ABC angle} was also assumed to be a right-angle.
Thus, angle {ABF angle} (is) equal to {ABC angle}.
And they are in one plane.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {BC line} is not in a more elevated plane.
Thus, the three straight-lines {BC line}, {BD line}, and {BE line} are in one plane.

Thus, if a straight-line is set up at right-angles to three straight-lines cutting one another, at the (common) point of section, then the three straight-lines are in one plane.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
