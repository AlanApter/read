Parallelepiped solids which are on the same base, and (have) the same height, and in which the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up are not on the same straight-lines, are equal to one another.

Let the parallelepiped solids {CM given} and {CN given} be on the same base, {AB polygon}, and (have) the same height, and let the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {AF line}, {AG line}, {LM line}, {LN line}, {CD line}, {CE line}, {BH line}, and {BK line}, not be on the same straight-lines.
I say that the solid {CM given} is equal to the solid {CN given}.

For let {NK line} and {DH line} have been produced, and let them have joined one another at {R point}.
And, further, let {FM line} and {GE line} have been produced to {P point} and {Q point} (respectively).
And let {AO line}, {LP line}, {CQ line}, and {BR line} have been joined.
So, solid {CM given}, whose base (is) parallelogram {ACBL polygon}, and opposite (face) {FDHM polygon}, is equal to solid {CP given}, whose base (is) parallelogram {ACBL polygon}, and opposite (face) {OQRP polygon}.
For they are on the same base, {ACBL polygon}, and (have) the same height, and the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {AF line}, {AO line}, {LM line}, {LP line}, {CD line}, {CQ line}, {BH line}, and {BR line}, are on the same straight-lines, {FP line} and {DR line} [Prop. 11.29].
But, solid {CP given}, whose base is parallelogram {ACBL polygon}, and opposite (face) {OQRP polygon}, is equal to solid {CN given}, whose base (is) parallelogram {ACBL polygon}, and opposite (face) {GEKN polygon}.
For, again, they are on the same base, {ACBL polygon}, and (have) the same height, and the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {AG line}, {AO line}, {CE line}, {CQ line}, {LN line}, {LP line}, {BK line}, and {BR line}, are on the same straight-lines, {GQ line} and {NR line} [Prop. 11.29].
Hence, solid {CM given} is also equal to solid {CN given}.

Thus, parallelepiped solids (which are) on the same base, and (have) the same height, and in which the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up are not on the same straight-lines, are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
