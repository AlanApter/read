If there are two parallel straight-lines, and random points are taken on each of them, then the straight-line joining the two points is in the same plane as the parallel (straight-lines).

Let {AB line} and {CD line} be two parallel straight-lines, and let the random points {E point} and {F point} have been taken on each of them (respectively).
I say that the straight-line joining points {E point} and {F point} is in the same (reference) plane as the parallel (straight-lines).

For (if) not, and if possible, let it be in a more elevated (plane), such as {EGF given}.
And let a plane have been drawn through {EGF given}.
So it will make a straight cutting in the reference plane [Prop. 11.3].
Let it make {EF line}.
Thus, two straight-lines (with the same end-points), {EGF given} and {EF line}, will enclose an area.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, the straight-line joining {E point} to {F point} is not in a more elevated plane.
The straight-line joining {E point} to {F point} is thus in the plane through the parallel (straight-lines) {AB line} and {CD line}.

Thus, if there are two parallel straight-lines, and random points are taken on each of them, then the straight-line joining the two points is in the same plane as the parallel (straight-lines).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
