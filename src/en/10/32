To find two medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area), such that the square on the greater is larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the greater.

Let three rational (straight-lines), {A magnitude}, {B magnitude} and {C magnitude}, commensurable in square only, be laid out such that the square on {A magnitude} is greater than (the square on {C magnitude}) by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({A magnitude}) [Prop. 10.29].
And let the (square) on {D magnitude} be equal to the (rectangle contained) by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.
Thus, the (square) on {D magnitude} (is) medial.
Thus, {D magnitude} is also medial [Prop. 10.21].
And let the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} be equal to the (rectangle contained) by {B magnitude} and {C magnitude}.
And since as the (rectangle contained) by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} is to the (rectangle contained) by {B magnitude} and {C magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], but the (square) on {D magnitude} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, and the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} to the (rectangle contained) by {B magnitude} and {C magnitude}, thus as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so the (square) on {D magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}.
And as the (square) on {D magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.].
And thus as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.
And {A magnitude} (is) commensurable in square [only] with {C magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} (is) also commensurable in square only with {E magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
And {D magnitude} (is) medial.
Thus, {E magnitude} (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23].
And since as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, (so) {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, and the square on {A magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {C magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({A magnitude}), the square on {D magnitude} will thus also be greater than (the square on) {E magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({D magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].
So, I also say that the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} is medial.
For since the (rectangle contained) by {B magnitude} and {C magnitude} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}, and the (rectangle contained) by {B magnitude} and {C magnitude} (is) medial [for {B magnitude} and {C magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only] [Prop. 10.21], the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} (is) thus also medial.

Thus, two medial (straight-lines), {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}, commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area), have been found such that the square on the greater is larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the greater.

So, similarly, (the proposition) can again also be demonstrated for (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length with the greater), provided that the square on {A magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {C magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({A magnitude}) [Prop. 10.30].
