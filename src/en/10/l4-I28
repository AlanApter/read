To find two square numbers such that the sum of them is also square.

Let the two numbers {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} be laid down.
And let them be either (both) even or (both) odd.
And since, if an even (number) is subtracted from an even (number), or if an odd (number is subtracted) from an odd (number), then the remainder is even [Props. 9.24, 9.26], the remainder {AC magnitude} is thus even.
Let {AC magnitude} have been cut in half at {D magnitude}.
And let {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} also be either similar plane (numbers), or square (numbers)---which are themselves also similar plane (numbers).
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, plus the square on {CD magnitude}, is equal to the square on {BD magnitude} [Prop. 2.6].
And the (number created) from (multiplying) {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is square---inasmuch as it was shown that if two similar plane (numbers) make some (number) by multiplying one another then the (number so) created is square [Prop. 9.1].
Thus, two square numbers have been found---(namely,) the (number created) from (multiplying) {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, and the (square) on {CD magnitude}---which, (when) added (together), make the square on {BD magnitude}.

And (it is) clear that two square (numbers) have again been found---(namely,) the (square) on {BD magnitude}, and the (square) on {CD magnitude}---such that their difference---(namely,) the (rectangle) contained by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}---is square whenever {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are similar plane (numbers).
But, when they are not similar plane numbers, two square (numbers) have been found---(namely,) the (square) on {BD magnitude}, and the (square) on {DC magnitude}---between which the difference---(namely,) the (rectangle) contained by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}---is not square.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
