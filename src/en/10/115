An infinite (series) of irrational (straight-lines) can be created from a medial (straight-line), and none of them is the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).

Let {A magnitude} be a medial (straight-line).
I say that an infinite (series) of irrational (straight-lines) can be created from {A magnitude}, and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).

Let the rational (straight-line) {B magnitude} be laid down.
And let the (square) on {C magnitude} be equal to the (rectangle contained) by {B magnitude} and {A magnitude}.
Thus, {C magnitude} is irrational [Def. 10.4].
For an (area contained) by an irrational and a rational (straight-line) is irrational [Prop. 10.20].
And ({C magnitude} is) not the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).
For the (square) on none of the preceding (straight-lines), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a medial (straight-line) as breadth.
So, again, let the (square) on {D magnitude} be equal to the (rectangle contained) by {B magnitude} and {C magnitude}.
Thus, the (square) on {D magnitude} is irrational [Prop. 10.20].
{D magnitude} is thus irrational [Def. 10.4].
And ({D magnitude} is) not the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).
For the (square) on none of the preceding (straight-lines), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces {C magnitude} as breadth.
So, similarly, this arrangement being advanced to infinity, it is clear that an infinite (series) of irrational (straight-lines) can be created from a medial (straight-line), and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding (straight-lines).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
