If a rational (area) is applied to a rational (straightline) then it produces as breadth a (straight-line which is) rational, and commensurable in length with the (straightline) to which it is applied.

For let the rational (area) {AC polygon} have been applied to the rational (straight-line) {AB line}, producing the (straight-line) {BC line} as breadth.
I say that {BC line} is rational, and commensurable in length with {BA line}.

For let the square {AD polygon} have been described on {AB line}.
{AD polygon} is thus rational [Def. 10.4].
And {AC polygon} (is) also rational.
{DA polygon} is thus commensurable with {AC polygon}.
And as {DA polygon} is to {AC polygon}, so {DB line} (is) to {BC line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {DB line} is also commensurable (in length) with {BC line} [Prop. 10.11].
And {DB line} (is) equal to {BA line}.
Thus, {AB line} (is) also commensurable (in length) with {BC line}.
And {AB line} is rational.
Thus, {BC line} is also rational, and commensurable in length with {AB line} [Def. 10.3].

Thus, if a rational (area) is applied to a rational (straight-line), and so on ....
