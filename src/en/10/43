A first bimedial (straight-line) can be divided (into its component terms) at one point only

Let {AB magnitude} be a first bimedial (straight-line) which has been divided at {C point}, such that {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a rational (area) [Prop. 10.37].
I say that {AB magnitude} cannot be (so) divided at another point.

For, if possible, let it also have been divided at {D point}, such that {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are also medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a rational (area).
Since, therefore, by whatever (amount) twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} differs from twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} by this (same amount) [Prop. 10.41 lem.].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} differs from twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area).
For (they are) both rational (areas).
(The sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} thus differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} by a rational (area, despite both) being medial (areas).
The very thing is absurd [Prop. 10.26].

Thus, a first bimedial (straight-line) cannot be divided into its (component) terms at different points.
Thus, (it can be so divided) at one point only.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
