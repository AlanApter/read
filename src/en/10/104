A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with an apotome of a medial (straight-line) is an apotome of a medial (straight-line), and (is) the same in order.

Let {AB magnitude} be an apotome of a medial (straight-line), and let {CD magnitude} be commensurable in length with {AB magnitude}.
I say that {CD magnitude} is also an apotome of a medial (straight-line), and (is) the same in order as {AB magnitude}.

For since {AB magnitude} is an apotome of a medial (straight-line), let {EB magnitude} be an attachment to it.
Thus, {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Props. 10.74, 10.75].
And let it have been contrived that as {AB magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, so {BE magnitude} (is) to {DF magnitude} [Prop. 6.12].
Thus, {AE magnitude} [is] also commensurable (in length) with {CF magnitude}, and {BE magnitude} with {DF magnitude} [Props. 5.12, 10.11].
And {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are thus also medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Props. 10.23, 10.13].
Thus, {CD magnitude} is an apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Props. 10.74, 10.75].
So, I say that it is also the same in order as {AB magnitude}.

[For] since as {AE magnitude} is to {EB magnitude}, so {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Props. 5.12, 5.16] [but as {AE magnitude} (is) to {EB magnitude}, so the (square) on {AE magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude}, and as {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}, so the (square) on {CF magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}], thus as the (square) on {AE magnitude} is to the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude}, so the (square) on {CF magnitude} also (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.] [and, alternately, as the (square) on {AE magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {CF magnitude}, so the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}].
And the (square) on {AE magnitude} (is) commensurable with the (square) on {CF magnitude}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is also commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} [Props. 5.16, 10.11].
Therefore, either the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is rational, and the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} will also be rational [Def. 10.4], or the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} [is] medial, and the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} [is] also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].

Therefore, {CD magnitude} is the apotome of a medial (straight-line), and is the same in order as {AB magnitude} [Props. 10.74, 10.75].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
