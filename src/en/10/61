The square on a first bimedial (straight-line) applied to a rational (straight-line) produces as breadth a second binomial (straight-line).

Let {AB magnitude} be a first bimedial (straight-line) having been divided into its (component) medial (straight-lines) at {C point}, of which {AC magnitude} (is) the greater.
And let the rational (straight-line) {DE line} be laid down.
And let the parallelogram {DF polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {DE line}, producing {DG line} as breadth.
I say that {DG line} is a second binomial (straight-line).

For let the same construction have been made as in the (proposition) before this.
And since {AB magnitude} is a first bimedial (straight-line), having been divided at {C point}, {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are thus medial (straight-lines) commensurable in square only, and containing a rational (area) [Prop. 10.37].
Hence, the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are also medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, {DL polygon} is medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {DE line}.
{MD line} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {DE line} [Prop. 10.22].
Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is rational, {MF polygon} is also rational.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {ML line}.
Thus, {MG line} [is] also rational, and commensurable in length with {ML line}---that is to say, with {DE line} [Prop. 10.20].
{DM line} is thus incommensurable in length with {MG line} [Prop. 10.13].
And they are rational.
{DM line} and {MG line} are thus rational, and commensurable in square only.
{DG line} is thus a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, we must show that (it is) also a second (binomial straight-line).

For since (the sum of) the squares on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.59], {DL polygon} (is) thus also greater than {MF polygon}.
Hence, {DM line} (is) also (greater) than {MG line} [Prop. 6.1].
And since the (square) on {AC magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {CB magnitude}, {DH polygon} is also commensurable with {KL polygon}.
Hence, {DK line} is also commensurable (in length) with {KM line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And the (rectangle contained) by {DKM line} is equal to the (square) on {MN line}.
Thus, the square on {DM line} is greater than (the square on) {MG line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DM line}) [Prop. 10.17].
And {MG line} is commensurable in length with {DE line}.

Thus, {DG line} is a second binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.6].
