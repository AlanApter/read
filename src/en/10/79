[Only] one rational straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, can be attached to an apotome.

Let {AB magnitude} be an apotome, with {BC magnitude} (so) attached to it.
{AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
I say that another rational (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, cannot be attached to {AB magnitude}.

For, if possible, let {BD magnitude} be (so) attached (to {AB magnitude}).
Thus, {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are also rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And since by whatever (area) the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}, the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} also exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by this (same area).
For both exceed by the same (area)---(namely), the (square) on {AB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].
Thus, alternately, by whatever (area) the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} [also] exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by this (same area).
And the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area).
For both (are) rational (areas).
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} also exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area).
The very thing is impossible.
For both are medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21], and a medial (area) cannot exceed a(nother) medial (area) by a rational (area) [Prop. 10.26].
Thus, another rational (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, cannot be attached to {AB magnitude}.

Thus, only one rational (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, can be attached to an apotome.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
