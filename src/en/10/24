A rectangle contained by medial straight-lines (which are) commensurable in length is medial.

For let the rectangle {AC polygon} be contained by the medial straight-lines {AB line} and {BC line} (which are) commensurable in length.
I say that {AC polygon} is medial.

For let the square {AD polygon} have been described on {AB line}.
{AD polygon} is thus medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
And since {AB line} is commensurable in length with {BC line}, and {AB line} (is) equal to {BD line}, {DB line} is thus also commensurable in length with {BC line}.
Hence, {DA polygon} is also commensurable with {AC polygon} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And {DA polygon} (is) medial.
Thus, {AC polygon} (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
