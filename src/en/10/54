If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called binomial.

For let the area {AC polygon} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB line} and by the first binomial (straight-line) {AD line}.
I say that square-root of area {AC polygon} is the irrational (straight-line which is) called binomial.

For since {AD line} is a first binomial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at {E point}, and let {AE line} be the greater term.
So, (it is) clear that {AE line} and {ED line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and that the square on {AE line} is greater than (the square on) {ED line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE line}), and that {AE line} is commensurable (in length) with the rational (straight-line) {AB line} (first) laid out [Def. 10.5].
So, let {ED line} have been cut in half at point {F point}.
And since the square on {AE line} is greater than (the square on) {ED line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE line}), thus if a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser (term)---that is to say, the (square) on {EF line}---falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater (term) {AE line}, then it divides it into (terms which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].
Therefore, let the (rectangle contained) by {AG line} and {GE line}, equal to the (square) on {EF line}, have been applied to {AE line}.
{AG line} is thus commensurable in length with {EG line}.
And let {GH line}, {EK line}, and {FL line} have been drawn from (points) {G point}, {E point}, and {F point} (respectively), parallel to either of {AB line} or {CD line}.
And let the square {SN polygon}, equal to the parallelogram {AH polygon}, have been constructed, and (the square) {NQ polygon}, equal to (the parallelogram) {GK polygon} [Prop. 2.14].
And let {MN line} be laid down so as to be straight-on to {NO line}.
{RN line} is thus also straight-on to {NP line}.
And let the parallelogram {SQ polygon} have been completed.
{SQ polygon} is thus a square [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AG line} and {GE line} is equal to the (square) on {EF line}, thus as {AG line} is to {EF line}, so {FE line} (is) to {EG line} [Prop. 6.17].
And thus as {AH polygon} (is) to {EL polygon}, (so) {EL polygon} (is) to {KG polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EL polygon} is the mean proportional to {AH polygon} and {GK polygon}.
But, {AH polygon} is equal to {SN polygon}, and {GK polygon} (is) equal to {NQ polygon}.
{EL polygon} is thus the mean proportional to {SN polygon} and {NQ polygon}.
And {MR polygon} is also the mean proportional to the same---(namely), {SN polygon} and {NQ polygon} [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
{EL polygon} is thus equal to {MR polygon}.
Hence, it is also equal to {PO polygon} [Prop. 1.43].
And {AH polygon} plus {GK polygon} is equal to {SN polygon} plus {NQ polygon}.
Thus, the whole of {AC polygon} is equal to the whole of {SQ polygon}---that is to say, to the square on {MO line}.
Thus, {MO line} (is) the square-root of (area) {AC polygon}.
I say that {MO line} is a binomial (straight-line).

For since {AG line} is commensurable (in length) with {GE line}, {AE line} is also commensurable (in length) with each of {AG line} and {GE line} [Prop. 10.15].
And {AE line} was also assumed (to be) commensurable (in length) with {AB line}.
Thus, {AG line} and {GE line} are also commensurable (in length) with {AB line} [Prop. 10.12].
And {AB line} is rational.
{AG line} and {GE line} are thus each also rational.
Thus, {AH polygon} and {GK polygon} are each rational (areas), and {AH polygon} is commensurable with {GK polygon} [Prop. 10.19].
But, {AH polygon} is equal to {SN polygon}, and {GK polygon} to {NQ polygon}.
{SN polygon} and {NQ polygon}---that is to say, the (squares) on {MN line} and {NO line} (respectively)---are thus also rational and commensurable.
And since {AE line} is incommensurable in length with {ED line}, but {AE line} is commensurable (in length) with {AG line}, and {DE line} (is) commensurable (in length) with {EF line}, {AG line} (is) thus also incommensurable (in length) with {EF line} [Prop. 10.13].
Hence, {AH polygon} is also incommensurable with {EL polygon} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
But, {AH polygon} is equal to {SN polygon}, and {EL polygon} to {MR polygon}.
Thus, {SN polygon} is also incommensurable with {MR polygon}.
But, as {SN polygon} (is) to {MR polygon}, (so) {PN line} (is) to {NR line} [Prop. 6.1].
{PN line} is thus incommensurable (in length) with {NR line} [Prop. 10.11].
And {PN line} (is) equal to {MN line}, and {NR line} to {NO line}.
Thus, {MN line} is incommensurable (in length) with {NO line}.
And the (square) on {MN line} is commensurable with the (square) on {NO line}, and each (is) rational.
{MN line} and {NO line} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.

Thus, {MO line} is (both) a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36], and the square-root of {AC polygon}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
