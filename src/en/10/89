To find a fifth apotome.

Let the rational (straight-line) {A magnitude} be laid down, and let {CG magnitude} be commensurable in length with {A magnitude}.
Thus, {CG magnitude} [is] a rational (straight-line).
And let the two numbers {DF magnitude} and {FE magnitude} be laid down such that {DE magnitude} again does not have to each of {DF magnitude} and {FE magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let it have been contrived that as {FE magnitude} (is) to {ED magnitude}, so the (square) on {CG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GB magnitude}.
Thus, the (square) on {GB magnitude} (is) also rational [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, {BG magnitude} is also rational.
And since as {DE magnitude} is to {EF magnitude}, so the (square) on {BG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GC magnitude}.
And {DE magnitude} does not have to {EF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
The (square) on {BG magnitude} thus does not have to the (square) on {GC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {BG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
{BG magnitude} and {GC magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {BC magnitude} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a fifth (apotome).

For, let the (square) on {H magnitude} be that (area) by which the (square) on {BG magnitude} is greater than the (square) on {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.13 lem.].
Therefore, since as the (square) on {BG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GC magnitude}, so {DE magnitude} (is) to {EF magnitude}, thus, via conversion, as {ED magnitude} is to {DF magnitude}, so the (square) on {BG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {H magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {ED magnitude} does not have to {DF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {BG magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {H magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {BG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {H magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And the square on {BG magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GC magnitude} by the (square) on {H magnitude}.
Thus, the square on {GB magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GC magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with ({GB magnitude}).
And the attachment {CG magnitude} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {A magnitude}.
Thus, {BC magnitude} is a fifth apotome [Def. 10.15].

Thus, the fifth apotome {BC magnitude} has been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
