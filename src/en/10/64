The square on the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area) applied to a rational (straight-line) produces as breadth a fifth binomial (straight-line).

Let {AB magnitude} be the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area) having been divided into its (component) straight-lines at {C point}, such that {AC magnitude} is greater.
And let the rational (straight-line) {DE line} be laid down.
And let the (parallelogram) {DF polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {DE line}, producing {DG line} as breadth.
I say that {DG line} is a fifth binomial straight-line.

Let the same construction be made as in the (propositions) before this.
Therefore, since {AB magnitude} is the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area), having been divided at {C point}, {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are thus incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them rational [Prop. 10.40].
Therefore, since the sum of the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is medial, {DL polygon} is thus medial.
Hence, {DM line} is rational and incommensurable in length with {DE line} [Prop. 10.22].
Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {ACB magnitude}---that is to say, {MF polygon}---is rational, {MG line} (is) thus rational and commensurable (in length) with {DE line} [Prop. 10.20].
{DM line} (is) thus incommensurable (in length) with {MG line} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {DM line} and {MG line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {DG line} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that (it is) also a fifth (binomial straight-line).

For, similarly (to the previous propositions), it can be shown that the (rectangle contained) by {DKM line} is equal to the (square) on {MN line}, and {DK line} (is) incommensurable in length with {KM line}.
Thus, the square on {DM line} is greater than (the square on) {MG line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({DM line}) [Prop. 10.18].
And {DM line} and {MG line} are [rational] (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the lesser {MG line} is commensurable in length with {DE line}.

Thus, {DG line} is a fifth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.9].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
