The (square) on a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a second apotome as breadth.

Let {AB magnitude} be a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), and {CD line} a rational (straight-line).
And let {CE polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CF line} as breadth.
I say that {CF line} is a second apotome.

For let {BG magnitude} be an attachment to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a rational (area) [Prop. 10.74].
And let {CH polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CK line} as breadth, and {KL polygon}, equal to the (square) on {GB magnitude}, producing {KM line} as breadth.
Thus, the whole of {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
Thus, {CL polygon} (is) also a medial (area) [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD line}, producing {CM line} as breadth.
{CM line} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, of which the (square) on {AB magnitude} is equal to {CE polygon}, the remainder, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, is thus equal to {FL polygon} [Prop. 2.7].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [is] rational.
Thus, {FL polygon} (is) rational.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {FE line}, producing {FM line} as breadth.
{FM line} is thus also rational, and commensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.20].
Therefore, since the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}---that is to say, {CL polygon}---is medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}---that is to say, {FL polygon}---(is) rational, {CL polygon} is thus incommensurable with {FL polygon}.
And as {CL polygon} (is) to {FL polygon}, so {CM line} is to {FM line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {CM line} (is) incommensurable in length with {FM line} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {CM line} and {MF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF line} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a second (apotome).

For let {FM line} have been cut in half at {N point}.
And let {NO line} have been drawn through (point) {N point}, parallel to {CD line}.
Thus, {FO polygon} and {NL polygon} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is the mean proportional to the squares on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and the (square) on {AG magnitude} is equal to {CH polygon}, and the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} to {NL polygon}, and the (square) on {BG magnitude} to {KL polygon}, {NL polygon} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH polygon} and {KL polygon}.
Thus, as {CH polygon} is to {NL polygon}, so {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon} [Prop. 5.11].
But, as {CH polygon} (is) to {NL polygon}, so {CK line} is to {NM line}, and as {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {NM line} is to {MK line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, as {CK line} (is) to {NM line}, so {NM line} is to {KM line} [Prop. 5.11].
The (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line} is thus equal to the (square) on {NM line} [Prop. 6.17]---that is to say, to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line} [and since the (square) on {AG magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {BG magnitude}, {CH polygon} is also commensurable with {KL polygon}---that is to say, {CK line} with {KM line}].
Therefore, since {CM line} and {MF line} are two unequal straight-lines, and the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line}, equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {MF line}, has been applied to the greater {CM line}, falling short by a square figure, and divides it into commensurable (parts), the square on {CM line} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({CM line}) [Prop. 10.17].
The attachment {FM line} is also commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD line}.
{CF line} is thus a second apotome [Def. 10.16].

Thus, the (square) on a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a second apotome as breadth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
