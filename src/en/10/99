The (square) on a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a third apotome as breadth.

Let {AB magnitude} be the second apotome of a medial (straight-line), and {CD line} a rational (straight-line).
And let {CE polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CF line} as breadth.
I say that {CF line} is a third apotome.

For let {BG magnitude} be an attachment to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a medial (area) [Prop. 10.75].
And let {CH polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CK line} as breadth.
And let {KL polygon}, equal to the (square) on {BG magnitude}, have been applied to {KH line}, producing {KM line} as breadth.
Thus, the whole of {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [and the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is medial].
{CL polygon} (is) thus also medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD line}, producing {CM line} as breadth.
Thus, {CM line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since the whole of {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, of which {CE polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, the remainder {LF polygon} is thus equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].
Therefore, let {FM line} have been cut in half at point {N point}.
And let {NO line} have been drawn parallel to {CD line}.
Thus, {FO polygon} and {NL polygon} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
And the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} (is) medial.
Thus, {FL polygon} is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF line}, producing {FM line} as breadth.
{FM line} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} are commensurable in square only, {AG magnitude} [is] thus incommensurable in length with {GB magnitude}.
Thus, the (square) on {AG magnitude} is also incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
But, the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} with the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
The (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].
But, {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, and {FL polygon} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
Thus, {CL polygon} is incommensurable with {FL polygon}.
And as {CL polygon} (is) to {FL polygon}, so {CM line} is to {FM line} [Prop. 6.1].
{CM line} is thus incommensurable in length with {FM line} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {CM line} and {MF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF line} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a third (apotome).

For since the (square) on {AG magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {GB magnitude}, {CH polygon} (is) thus also commensurable with {KL polygon}.
Hence, {CK line} (is) also (commensurable in length) with {KM line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is the mean proportional to the (squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and {CH polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and {KL polygon} equal to the (square) on {GB magnitude}, and {NL polygon} equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {NL polygon} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH polygon} and {KL polygon}.
Thus, as {CH polygon} is to {NL polygon}, so {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}.
But, as {CH polygon} (is) to {NL polygon}, so {CK line} is to {NM line}, and as {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {NM line} (is) to {KM line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, as {CK line} (is) to {MN line}, so {MN line} is to {KM line} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line} is equal to the [(square) on {MN line}---that is to say, to the] fourth part of the (square) on {FM line} [Prop. 6.17].
Therefore, since {CM line} and {MF line} are two unequal straight-lines, and (some area), equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line}, has been applied to {CM line}, falling short by a square figure, and divides it into commensurable (parts), the square on {CM line} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({CM line}) [Prop. 10.17].
And neither of {CM line} and {MF line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD line}.
{CF line} is thus a third apotome [Def. 10.13].

Thus, the (square) on a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a third apotome as breadth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
