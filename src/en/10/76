If a straight-line, which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and with the whole makes the (squares) on them (added) together rational, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial, is subtracted from a(nother) straight-line then the remainder is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called a minor (straight-line).

For let the straight-line {BC magnitude}, which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the straight-line {AB magnitude} [Prop. 10.33].
I say that the remainder {AC magnitude} is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.

For since the sum of the squares on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) medial, the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}.
And, via conversion, the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is incommensurable with the remaining (square) on {AC magnitude} [Props. 2.7, 10.16].
And the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) rational.
The (square) on {AC magnitude} (is) thus irrational.
Thus, {AC magnitude} (is) an irrational (straight-line) [Def. 10.4].
Let it be called a minor (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
