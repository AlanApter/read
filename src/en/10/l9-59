If a straight-line is cut unequally then (the sum of) the squares on the unequal (parts) is greater than twice the rectangle contained by the unequal (parts).

Let {AB magnitude} be a straight-line, and let it have been cut unequally at {C point}, and let {AC magnitude} be greater (than {CB magnitude}).
I say that (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}.

For let {AB magnitude} have been cut in half at {D point}.
Therefore, since a straight-line has been cut into equal (parts) at {D point}, and into unequal (parts) at {C point}, the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, plus the (square) on {CD magnitude}, is thus equal to the (square) on {AD magnitude} [Prop. 2.5].
Hence, the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is less than the (square) on {AD magnitude}.
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is less than double the (square) on {AD magnitude}.
But, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [is] double (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DC magnitude} [Prop. 2.9].
Thus, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
