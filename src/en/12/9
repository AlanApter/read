The bases of equal pyramids which also have triangular bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
And those pyramids which have triangular bases whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal.

For let there be (two) equal pyramids having the triangular bases {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon}, and apexes the points {G point} and {H point} (respectively).
I say that the bases of the pyramids {ABCG given} and {DEFH given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (so) that as base {ABC polygon} is to base {DEF polygon}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH given} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG given}.

For let the parallelepiped solids {BGML given} and {EHQP given} have been completed.
And since pyramid {ABCG given} is equal to pyramid {DEFH given}, and solid {BGML given} is six times pyramid {ABCG given} (see previous proposition), and solid {EHQP given} (is) six times pyramid {DEFH given}, solid {BGML given} is thus equal to solid {EHQP given}.
And the bases of equal parallelepiped solids are reciprocally proportional to their heights [Prop. 11.34].
Thus, as base {BM polygon} is to base {EQ polygon}, so the height of solid {EHQP given} (is) to the height of solid {BGML given}.
But, as base {BM polygon} (is) to base {EQ polygon}, so triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to triangle {DEF polygon} [Prop. 1.34].
And, thus, as triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to triangle {DEF polygon}, so the height of solid {EHQP given} (is) to the height of solid {BGML given} [Prop. 5.11].
But, the height of solid {EHQP given} is the same as the height of pyramid {DEFH given}, and the height of solid {BGML given} is the same as the height of pyramid {ABCG given}.
Thus, as base {ABC polygon} is to base {DEF polygon}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH given} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG given}.
Thus, the bases of pyramids {ABCG given} and {DEFH given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.

And so, let the bases of pyramids {ABCG given} and {DEFH given} be reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (thus) let base {ABC polygon} be to base {DEF polygon}, as the height of pyramid {DEFH given} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG given}.
I say that pyramid {ABCG given} is equal to pyramid {DEFH given}.

For, with the same construction, since as base {ABC polygon} is to base {DEF polygon}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH given} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG given}, but as base {ABC polygon} (is) to base {DEF polygon}, so parallelogram {BM polygon} (is) to parallelogram {EQ polygon} [Prop. 1.34], thus as parallelogram {BM polygon} (is) to parallelogram {EQ polygon}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH given} (is) also to the height of pyramid {ABCG given} [Prop. 5.11].
But, the height of pyramid {DEFH given} is the same as the height of parallelepiped {EHQP given}, and the height of pyramid {ABCG given} is the same as the height of parallelepiped {BGML given}.
Thus, as base {BM polygon} is to base {EQ polygon}, so the height of parallelepiped {EHQP given} (is) to the height of parallelepiped {BGML given}.
And those parallelepiped solids whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal [Prop. 11.34].
Thus, the parallelepiped solid {BGML given} is equal to the parallelepiped solid {EHQP given}.
And pyramid {ABCG given} is a sixth part of {BGML given}, and pyramid {DEFH given} a sixth part of parallelepiped {EHQP given}.
Thus, pyramid {ABCG given} is equal to pyramid {DEFH given}.

Thus, the bases of equal pyramids which also have triangular bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
And those pyramids having triangular bases whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
