Pyramids which are of the same height, and have polygonal bases, are to one another as their bases.

Let there be pyramids of the same height whose bases (are) the polygons {ABCDE polygon} and {FGHKL polygon}, and apexes the points {M point} and {N point} (respectively).
I say that as base {ABCDE polygon} is to base {FGHKL polygon}, so pyramid {ABCDEM given} (is) to pyramid {FGHKLN given}.

For let {AC line}, {AD line}, {FH line}, and {FK line} have been joined.
Therefore, since {ABCM given} and {ACDM given} are two pyramids having triangular bases and equal height, they are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.5].
Thus, as base {ABC polygon} is to base {ACD polygon}, so pyramid {ABCM given} (is) to pyramid {ACDM given}.
And, via composition, as base {ABCD polygon} (is) to base {ACD polygon}, so pyramid {ABCDM given} (is) to pyramid {ACDM given} [Prop. 5.18].
But, as base {ACD polygon} (is) to base {ADE polygon}, so pyramid {ACDM given} (is) also to pyramid {ADEM given} [Prop. 12.5].
Thus, via equality, as base {ABCD polygon} (is) to base {ADE polygon}, so pyramid {ABCDM given} (is) to pyramid {ADEM given} [Prop. 5.22].
And, again, via composition, as base {ABCDE polygon} (is) to base {ADE polygon}, so pyramid {ABCDEM given} (is) to pyramid {ADEM given} [Prop. 5.18].
So, similarly, it can also be shown that as base {FGHKL polygon} (is) to base {FGH polygon}, so pyramid {FGHKLN given} (is) also to pyramid {FGHN given}.
And since {ADEM given} and {FGHN given} are two pyramids having triangular bases and equal height, thus as base {ADE polygon} (is) to base {FGH polygon}, so pyramid {ADEM given} (is) to pyramid {FGHN given} [Prop. 12.5].
But, as base {ADE polygon} (is) to base {ABCDE polygon}, so pyramid {ADEM given} (was) to pyramid {ABCDEM given}.
Thus, via equality, as base {ABCDE polygon} (is) to base {FGH polygon}, so pyramid {ABCDEM given} (is) also to pyramid {FGHN given} [Prop. 5.22].
But, furthermore, as base {FGH polygon} (is) to base {FGHKL polygon}, so pyramid {FGHN given} was also to pyramid {FGHKLN given}.
Thus, via equality, as base {ABCDE polygon} (is) to base {FGHKL polygon}, so pyramid {ABCDEM given} (is) also to pyramid {FGHKLN given} [Prop. 5.22].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
