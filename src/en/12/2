Circles are to one another as the squares on (their) diameters.

Let {ABCD circle X} and {EFGH circle Y} be circles, and [let] {BD line} and {FH line} [be] their diameters.
I say that as circle {ABCD circle X} is to circle {EFGH circle Y}, so the square on {BD line} (is) to the square on {FH line}.

For if the circle {ABCD circle X} is not to the (circle) {EFGH circle Y}, as the square on {BD line} (is) to the (square) on {FH line}, then as the (square) on {BD line} (is) to the (square) on {FH line}, so circle {ABCD circle X} will be to some area either less than, or greater than, circle {EFGH circle Y}.
Let it, first of all, be (in that ratio) to (some) lesser (area), {S given}.
And let the square {EFGH polygon} have been inscribed in circle {EFGH circle Y} [Prop. 4.6].
So the inscribed square is greater than half of circle {EFGH circle Y}, inasmuch as if we draw tangents to the circle through the points {E point}, {F point}, {G point}, and {H point}, then square {EFGH polygon} is half of the square circumscribed about the circle [Prop. 1.47], and the circle is less than the circumscribed square.
Hence, the inscribed square {EFGH polygon} is greater than half of circle {EFGH circle Y}.
Let the circumferences {EF arcc Y}, {FG arcc Y}, {GH arcc Y}, and {HE arcc Y} have been cut in half at points {K point}, {L point}, {M point}, and {N point} (respectively), and let {EK line}, {KF line}, {FL line}, {LG line}, {GM line}, {MH line}, {HN line}, and {NE line} have been joined.
And, thus, each of the triangles {EKF polygon}, {FLG polygon}, {GMH polygon}, and {HNE polygon} is greater than half of the segment of the circle about it, inasmuch as if we draw tangents to the circle through points {K point}, {L point}, {M point}, and {N point}, and complete the parallelograms on the straight-lines {EF line}, {FG line}, {GH line}, and {HE line}, then each of the triangles {EKF polygon}, {FLG polygon}, {GMH polygon}, and {HNE polygon} will be half of the parallelogram about it, but the segment about it is less than the parallelogram.
Hence, each of the triangles {EKF polygon}, {FLG polygon}, {GMH polygon}, and {HNE polygon} is greater than half of the segment of the circle about it.
So, by cutting the circumferences remaining behind in half, and joining straight-lines, and doing this continually, we will (eventually) leave behind some segments of the circle whose (sum) will be less than the excess by which circle {EFGH circle Y} exceeds the area {S given}.
For we showed in the first theorem of the tenth book that if two unequal magnitudes are laid out, and if (a part) greater than a half is subtracted from the greater, and (if from) the remainder (a part) greater than a half (is subtracted), and this happens continually, then some magnitude will (eventually) be left which will be less than the lesser laid out magnitude [Prop. 10.1].
Therefore, let the (segments) have been left, and let the (sum of the) segments of the circle {EFGH circle Y} on {EK arcc Y}, {KF arcc Y}, {FL arcc Y}, {LG arcc Y}, {GM arcc Y}, {MH arcc Y}, {HN arcc Y}, and {NE arcc Y} be less than the excess by which circle {EFGH circle Y} exceeds area {S given}.
Thus, the remaining polygon {EKFLGMHN polygon} is greater than area {S given}.
And let the polygon {AOBPCQDR polygon}, similar to the polygon {EKFLGMHN polygon}, have been inscribed in circle {ABCD circle X}.
Thus, as the square on {BD line} is to the square on {FH line}, so polygon {AOBPCQDR polygon} (is) to polygon {EKFLGMHN polygon} [Prop. 12.1].
But, also, as the square on {BD line} (is) to the square on {FH line}, so circle {ABCD circle X} (is) to area {S given}.
And, thus, as circle {ABCD circle X} (is) to area {S given}, so polygon {AOBPCQDR polygon} (is) to polygon {EKFLGMHN polygon} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, alternately, as circle {ABCD circle X} (is) to the polygon (inscribed) within it, so area {S given} (is) to polygon {EKFLGMHN polygon} [Prop. 5.16].
And circle {ABCD circle X} (is) greater than the polygon (inscribed) within it.
Thus, area {S given} is also greater than polygon {EKFLGMHN polygon}.
But, (it is) also less.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, the square on {BD line} is not to the (square) on {FH line}, as circle {ABCD circle X} (is) to some area less than circle {EFGH circle Y}.
So,similarly,wecan show that the (square) on {FH line} (is) not to the (square) on {BD line} as circle {EFGH circle Y} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD circle X} either.

So, I say that neither (is) the (square) on {BD line} to the (square) on {FH line}, as circle {ABCD circle X} (is) to some area greater than circle {EFGH circle Y}.

For, if possible, let it be (in that ratio) to (some) greater (area), {S given}.
Thus, inversely, as the square on {FH line} [is] to the (square) on {DB line}, so area {S given} (is) to circle {ABCD circle X} [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
But, as area {S given} (is) to circle {ABCD circle X}, so circle {EFGH circle Y} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD circle X} (see lemma).
And, thus, as the (square) on {FH line} (is) to the (square) on {BD line}, so circle {EFGH circle Y} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD circle X} [Prop. 5.11].
The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
Thus, as the square on {BD line} is to the (square) on {FH line}, so circle {ABCD circle X} (is) not to some area greater than circle {EFGH circle Y}.
And it was shown that neither (is it in that ratio) to (some) lesser (area).
Thus, as the square on {BD line} is to the (square) on {FH line}, so circle {ABCD circle X} (is) to circle {EFGH circle Y}.

Thus, circles are to one another as the squares on (their) diameters.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Lemma

So, I say that, area {S given} being greater than circle {EFGH circle Y}, as area {S given} is to circle {ABCD circle X}, so circle {EFGH circle Y} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD circle X}.

For let it have been contrived that as area {S given} (is) to circle {ABCD circle X}, so circle {EFGH circle Y} (is) to area {T given}.
I say that area {T given} is less than circle {ABCD circle X}.
For since as area {S given} is to circle {ABCD circle X}, so circle {EFGH circle Y} (is) to area {T given}, alternately, as area {S given} is to circle {EFGH circle Y}, so circle {ABCD circle X} (is) to area {T given} [Prop. 5.16].
And area {S given} (is) greater than circle {EFGH circle Y}.
Thus, circle {ABCD circle X} (is) also greater than area {T given} [Prop. 5.14].
Hence, as area {S given} is to circle {ABCD circle X}, so circle {EFGH circle Y} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD circle X}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
