To find a fourth (straight-line) proportional to three given straight-lines.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} be the three given straight-lines.
So it is required to find a fourth (straight-line) proportional to {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.

Let the two straight-lines {DE line} and {DF line} be set out encompassing the [random] angle {EDF angle}.
And let {DG line} be made equal to {A magnitude}, and {GE line} to {B magnitude}, and, further, {DH line} to {C magnitude} [Prop. 1.3].
And {GH line} being joined, let {EF line} have been drawn through (point) {E point} parallel to it [Prop. 1.31].

Therefore, since {GH line} has been drawn parallel to one of the sides {EF line} of triangle {DEF polygon}, thus as {DG line} is to {GE line}, so {DH line} (is) to {HF line} [Prop. 6.2].
And {DG line} (is) equal to {A magnitude}, and {GE line} to {B magnitude}, and {DH line} to {C magnitude}.
Thus, as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {HF line}.

Thus, a fourth (straight-line), {HF line}, has been found (which is) proportional to the three given straight-lines, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
