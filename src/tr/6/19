Similar triangles are to one another in the squared ratio of (their) corresponding sides.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be similar triangles having the angle at {B point} equal to the (angle) at {E point}, and {AB line} to {BC line}, as {DE line} (is) to {EF line}, such that {BC line} corresponds to {EF line}.
I say that triangle {ABC polygon} has a squared ratio to triangle {DEF polygon} with respect to (that side) {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.

For let a third (straight-line), {BG line}, have been taken (which is) proportional to {BC line} and {EF line}, so that as {BC line} (is) to {EF line}, so {EF line} (is) to {BG line} [Prop. 6.11].
And let {AG line} have been joined.

Therefore, since as {AB line} is to {BC line}, so {DE line} (is) to {EF line}, thus, alternately, as {AB line} is to {DE line}, so {BC line} (is) to {EF line} [Prop. 5.16].
But, as {BC line} (is) to {EF line}, so {EF line} is to {BG line}.
And, thus, as {AB line} (is) to {DE line}, so {EF line} (is) to {BG line}.
Thus, for triangles {ABG polygon} and {DEF polygon}, the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
And those triangles having one (angle) equal to one (angle) for which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal [Prop. 6.15].
Thus, triangle {ABG polygon} is equal to triangle {DEF polygon}.
And since as {BC line} (is) to {EF line}, so {EF line} (is) to {BG line}, and if three straight-lines are proportional then the first has a squared ratio to the third with respect to the second [Def. 5.9], {BC line} thus has a squared ratio to {BG line} with respect to (that) {CB line} (has) to {EF line}.
And as {CB line} (is) to {BG line}, so triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to triangle {ABG polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} also has a squared ratio to (triangle) {ABG polygon} with respect to (that side) {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.
And triangle {ABG polygon} (is) equal to triangle {DEF polygon}.
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} also has a squared ratio to triangle {DEF polygon} with respect to (that side) {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.

Thus, similar triangles are to one another in the squared ratio of (their) corresponding sides.
[(Which is) the very thing it was required to show].

Corollary

So it is clear, from this, that if three straight-lines are proportional, then as the first is to the third, so the figure (described) on the first (is) to the similar, and similarly described, (figure) on the second.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
