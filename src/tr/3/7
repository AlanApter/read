If some point, which is not the center of the circle, is taken on the diameter of a circle, and some straight-lines radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, then the greatest (straight-line) will be that on which the center (lies), and the least the remainder (of the same diameter).
And for the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the (straight-line) through the center is always greater than a (straight-line) further away.
And only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, (one) on each (side) of the least (straight-line).

Let {ABCD circle E} be a circle, and let {AD line} be its diameter, and let some point {F point}, which is not the center of the circle, have been taken on {AD line}.
Let {E point} be the center of the circle.
And let some straight-lines, {FB line}, {FC line}, and {FG line}, radiate from {F point} towards (the circumference of) circle {ABCD circle E}.
I say that {FA line} is the greatest (straight-line), {FD line} the least, and of the others, {FB line} (is) greater than {FC line}, and {FC line} than {FG line}.

For let {BE line}, {CE line}, and {GE line} have been joined.
And since for every triangle (any) two sides are greater than the remaining (side) [Prop. 1.20], {EB line} and {EF line} is thus greater than {BF line}.
And {AE line} (is) equal to {BE line} [thus, {BE line} and {EF line} is equal to {AF line}].
Thus, {AF line} (is) greater than {BF line}.
Again, since {BE line} is equal to {CE line}, and {FE line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {BE line}, {EF line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {CE line}, {EF line} (respectively).
But, angle {BEF angle} (is) also greater than angle {CEF angle}.
Thus, the base {BF line} is greater than the base {CF line}.
Thus, the base {BF line} is greater than the base {CF line} [Prop. 1.24].
So, for the same (reasons), {CF line} is also greater than {FG line}.

Again, since {GF line} and {FE line} are greater than {EG line} [Prop. 1.20], and {EG line} (is) equal to {ED line}, {GF line} and {FE line} are thus greater than {ED line}.
Let {EF line} have been taken from both.
Thus, the remainder {GF line} is greater than the remainder {FD line}.
Thus, {FA line} (is) the greatest (straight-line), {FD line} the least, and {FB line} (is) greater than {FC line}, and {FC line} than {FG line}.

I also say that from point {F point} only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate towards (the circumference of) circle {ABCD circle E}, (one) on each (side) of the least (straight-line) {FD line}.
For let the (angle) {FEH angle}, equal to angle {GEF angle}, have been constructed on the straight-line {EF line}, at the point {E point} on it [Prop. 1.23], and let {FH line} have been joined.
Therefore, since {GE line} is equal to {EH line}, and {EF line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {GE line}, {EF line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {HE line}, {EF line} (respectively).
And angle {GEF angle} (is) equal to angle {HEF angle}.
Thus, the base {FG line} is equal to the base {FH line} [Prop. 1.4].
So I say that another (straight-line) equal to {FG line} will not radiate towards (the circumference of) the circle from point {F point}.
For, if possible, let {FK line} (so) radiate.
And since {FK line} is equal to {FG line}, but {FH line} [is equal] to {FG line}, {FK line} is thus also equal to {FH line}, the nearer to the (straight-line) through the center equal to the further away.
The very thing (is) impossible.
Thus, another (straight-line) equal to {GF line} will not radiate from the point {F point} towards (the circumference of) the circle.
Thus, (there is) only one (such straight-line).

Thus, if some point, which is not the center of the circle, is taken on the diameter of a circle, and some straight-lines radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, then the greatest (straight-line) will be that on which the center (lies), and the least the remainder (of the same diameter).
And for the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the (straight-line) through the center is always greater than a (straight-line) further away.
And only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate from the same point towards the (circumference of the) circle, (one) on each (side) of the least (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
