In a circle, angles in the same segment are equal to one another.

Let {ABCD circle F} be a circle, and let {BAD angle} and {BED angle} be angles in the same segment {BAED arc F}.
I say that angles {BAD angle} and {BED angle} are equal to one another.

For let the center of circle {ABCD circle F} have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let it be (at point) {F point}.
And let {BF line} and {FD line} have been joined.

And since angle {BFD angle} is at the center, and {BAD angle} at the circumference, and they have the same circumference base {BCD arcc F}, angle {BFD angle} is thus double {BAD angle} [Prop. 3.20].

So, for the same (reasons), {BFD angle} is also double {BED angle}.
Thus, {BAD angle} (is) equal to {BED angle}.
Thus, in a circle, angles in the same segment are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
