To draw a straight-line touching a given circle from a given point.

Let {A point} be the given point, and {BCD circle E} the given circle.
So it is required to draw a straight-line touching circle {BCD circle E} from point {A point}.

For let the center {E point} of the circle have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let {AE line} have been joined.
And let (the circle) {AFG circle E} have been drawn with center {E point} and radius {EA line}.
And let {DF line} have been drawn from from (point) {D point}, at right-angles to {EA line} [Prop. 1.11].
And let {EF line} and {AB line} have been joined.
I say that the (straight-line) {AB line} has been drawn from point {A point} touching circle {BCD circle E}.

For since {E point} is the center of circles {BCD circle E} and {AFG circle E}, {EA line} is thus equal to {EF line}, and {ED line} to {EB line}.
So the two (straight-lines) {AE line}, {EB line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {FE line}, {ED line} (respectively).
And they contain a common angle at {E point}.
Thus, the base {DF line} is equal to the base {AB line}, and triangle {DEF polygon} is equal to triangle {EBA polygon}, and the remaining angles (are equal) to the (corresponding) remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, (angle) {EDF angle} (is) equal to {EBA angle}.
And {EDF angle} (is) a right-angle.
Thus, {EBA angle} (is) also a right-angle.
And {EB line} is a radius.
And a (straight-line) drawn at right-angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle [Prop. 3.16 corr.].
Thus, {AB line} touches circle {BCD circle E}.

Thus, the straight-line {AB line} has been drawn touching the given circle {BCD circle E} from the given point {A point}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
