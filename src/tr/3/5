If two circles cut one another then they will not have the same center.

For let the two circles {ABC circle L} and {CDG circle K} cut one another at points {B point} and {C point}.
I say that they will not have the same center.

For, if possible, let {E point} be (the common center), and let {EC line} have been joined, and let {EFG line} have been drawn through (the two circles), at random.
And since point {E point} is the center of the circle {ABC circle L}, {EC line} is equal to {EF line}.
Again, since point {E point} is the center of the circle {CDG circle K}, {EC line} is equal to {EG line}.
But {EC line} was also shown (to be) equal to {EF line}.
Thus, {EF line} is also equal to {EG line}, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, point {E point} is not the (common) center of the circles {ABC circle L} and {CDG circle K}.

Thus, if two circles cut one another then they will not have the same center.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
