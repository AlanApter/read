To inscribe a circle in a given triangle.

Let {ABC polygon} be the given triangle.
So it is required to inscribe a circle in triangle {ABC polygon}.

Let the angles {ABC angle} and {ACB angle} have been cut in half by the straight-lines {BD line} and {CD line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.9], and let them meet one another at point {D point}, and let {DE line}, {DF line}, and {DG line} have been drawn from point {D point}, perpendicular to the straight-lines {AB line}, {BC line}, and {CA line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.12].

And since angle {ABD angle} is equal to {CBD angle}, and the right-angle {BED angle} is also equal to the right-angle {BFD angle}, {EBD polygon} and {FBD polygon} are thus two triangles having two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal to one side---the (one) subtending one of the equal angles (which is) common to the (triangles)---(namely), {BD line}.
Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides [Prop. 1.26].
Thus, {DE line} (is) equal to {DF line}.
So, for the same (reasons), {DG line} is also equal to {DF line}.
Thus, the three straight-lines {DE line}, {DF line}, and {DG line} are equal to one another.
Thus, the circle drawn with center {D point}, and radius one of {E point}, {F point}, or {G point}, will also go through the remaining points, and will touch the straight-lines {AB line}, {BC line}, and {CA line}, on account of the angles at {E point}, {F point}, and {G point} being right-angles.
For if it cuts (one of) them then it will be a (straight-line) drawn at right-angles to a diameter of the circle, from its extremity, falling inside the circle.
The very thing was shown (to be) absurd [Prop. 3.16].
Thus, the circle drawn with center {D point}, and radius one of {E point}, {F point}, or {G point}, does not cut the straight-lines {AB line}, {BC line}, and {CA line}.
Thus, it will touch them and will be the circle inscribed in triangle {ABC polygon}.
Let it have been (so) inscribed, like {FGE circle D} (in the figure).

Thus, the circle {EFG circle D} has been inscribed in the given triangle {ABC polygon}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
