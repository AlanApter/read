To circumscribe a circle about a given triangle.

Let {ABC polygon} be the given triangle.
So it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle {ABC polygon}.

Let the straight-lines {AB line} and {AC line} have been cut in half at points {D point} and {E point} (respectively) [Prop. 1.10].
And let {DF line} and {EF line} have been drawn from points {D point} and {E point}, at right-angles to {AB line} and {AC line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.11].
So ({DF line} and {EF line} ) will surely either meet inside triangle {ABC polygon}, on the straight-line {BC line}, or beyond {BC line}.

{figure 1}Let them, first of all, meet inside (triangle {ABC polygon}) at (point) {F point}, and let {FB line}, {FC line}, and {FA line} have been joined.
And since {AD line} is equal to {DB line}, and {DF line} is common and at right-angles, the base {AF line} is thus equal to the base {FB line} [Prop. 1.4].
So, similarly, we can show that {CF line} is also equal to {AF line}.
So that {FB line} is also equal to {FC line}.
Thus, the three (straight-lines) {FA line}, {FB line}, and {FC line} are equal to one another.
Thus, the circle drawn with center {F point}, and radius one of {A point}, {B point}, or {C point}, will also go through the remaining points.
And the circle will have been circumscribed about triangle {ABC polygon}.
Let it have been (so) circumscribed, like {ABC circle F} (in the first diagram from the left).

{figure 2}And so, let {DF line} and {EF line} meet on the straight-line {BC line} at (point) {F point}, like in the second diagram (from the left).
And let {AF line} have been joined.
So, similarly, we can show that point {F point} is the center of the circle circumscribed about triangle {ABC polygon}.

{figure 3}And so, let {DF line} and {EF line} meet outside triangle {ABC polygon}, again at (point) {F point}, like in the third diagram (from the left).
And let {AF line}, {BF line}, and {CF line} have been joined.
And, again, since {AD line} is equal to {DB line}, and {DF line} is common and at right-angles, the base {AF line} is thus equal to the base {BF line} [Prop. 1.4].
So, similarly, we can show that {CF line} is also equal to {AF line}.
So that {BF line} is also equal to {FC line}.
Thus, [again] the circle drawn with center {F point}, and radius one of {FA line}, {FB line}, and {FC line}, will also go through the remaining points.
And it will have been circumscribed about triangle {ABC polygon}.

Thus, a circle has been circumscribed about the given triangle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
