To circumscribe a triangle, equiangular with a given triangle, about a given circle.

Let {ABC circle K} be the given circle, and {DEF polygon} the given triangle.
So it is required to circumscribe a triangle, equiangular with triangle {DEF polygon}, about circle {ABC circle K}.

Let {EF line} have been produced in each direction to points {G point} and {H point}.
And let the center {K point} of circle {ABC circle K} have been found [Prop. 3.1].
And let the straight-line {KB line} have been drawn, at random, across ({ABC circle K}).
And let (angle) {BKA angle}, equal to angle {DEG angle}, have been constructed on the straight-line {KB line} at the point {K point} on it, and (angle) {BKC angle}, equal to {DFH angle} [Prop. 1.23].
And let the (straight-lines) {LAM line}, {MBN line}, and {NCL line} have been drawn through the points {A point}, {B point}, and {C point} (respectively), touching the circle {ABC circle K}.

And since {LM line}, {MN line}, and {NL line} touch circle {ABC circle K} at points {A point}, {B point}, and {C point} (respectively), and {KA line}, {KB line}, and {KC line} are joined from the center {K point} to points {A point}, {B point}, and {C point} (respectively), the angles at points {A point}, {B point}, and {C point} are thus right-angles [Prop. 3.18].
And since the (sum of the) four angles of quadrilateral {AMBK polygon} is equal to four right-angles, inasmuch as {AMBK polygon} (can) also (be) divided into two triangles [Prop. 1.32], and angles {KAM angle} and {KBM angle} are (both) right-angles, the (sum of the) remaining (angles), {AKB angle} and {AMB angle}, is thus equal to two right-angles.
And {DEG angle} and {DEF angle} is also equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
Thus, {AKB angle} and {AMB angle} is equal to {DEG angle} and {DEF angle}, of which {AKB angle} is equal to {DEG angle}.
Thus, the remainder {AMB angle} is equal to the remainder {DEF angle}.
So, similarly, it can be shown that {LNB angle} is also equal to {DFE angle}.
Thus, the remaining (angle) {MLN angle} is also equal to the [remaining] (angle) {EDF angle} [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, triangle {LMN polygon} is equiangular with triangle {DEF polygon}.
And it has been drawn around circle {ABC circle K}.

Thus, a triangle, equiangular with the given triangle, has been circumscribed about the given circle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
