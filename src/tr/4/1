To insert a straight-line equal to a given straight-line into a circle, (the latter straight-line) not being greater than the diameter of the circle.

Let {ABC circle G} be the given circle, and {D given} the given straight-line (which is) not greater than the diameter of the circle.
So it is required to insert a straight-line, equal to the straight-line {D given}, into the circle {ABC circle G}.

Let a diameter {BC line} of circle {ABC circle G} have been drawn.
Therefore, if {BC line} is equal to {D given} then that (which) was prescribed has taken place.
For the (straight-line) {BC line}, equal to the straight-line {D given}, has been inserted into the circle {ABC circle G}.
And if {BC line} is greater than {D given} then let {CE line} be made equal to {D given} [Prop. 1.3], and let the circle {EAF circle C} have been drawn with center {C point} and radius {CE line}.
And let {CA line} have been joined.

Therefore, since the point {C point} is the center of circle {EAF circle C}, {CA line} is equal to {CE line}.
But, {CE line} is equal to {D given}.
Thus, {D given} is also equal to {CA line}.

Thus, {CA line}, equal to the given straight-line {D given}, has been inserted into the given circle {ABC circle G}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
