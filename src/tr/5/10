For (magnitudes) having a ratio to the same (magnitude), that (magnitude which) has the greater ratio is (the) greater.
And that (magnitude) to which the latter (magnitude) has a greater ratio is (the) lesser.

For let {A magnitude} have a greater ratio to {C magnitude} than {B magnitude} (has) to {C magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} is greater than {B magnitude}.

For if not, {A magnitude} is surely either equal to or less than {B magnitude}.
In fact, {A magnitude} is not equal to {B magnitude}.
For (then) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} would each have the same ratio to {C magnitude} [Prop. 5.7].
But they do not.
Thus, {A magnitude} is not equal to {B magnitude}.
Neither, indeed, is {A magnitude} less than {B magnitude}.
For (then) {A magnitude} would have a lesser ratio to {C magnitude} than {B magnitude} (has) to {C magnitude} [Prop. 5.8].
But it does not.
Thus, {A magnitude} is not less than {B magnitude}.
And it was shown not (to be) equal either.
Thus, {A magnitude} is greater than {B magnitude}.

So, again, let {C magnitude} have a greater ratio to {B magnitude} than {C magnitude} (has) to {A magnitude}.
I say that {B magnitude} is less than {A magnitude}.

For if not, (it is) surely either equal or greater.
In fact, {B magnitude} is not equal to {A magnitude}.
For (then) {C magnitude} would have the same ratio to each of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} [Prop. 5.7].
But it does not.
Thus, {A magnitude} is not equal to {B magnitude}.
Neither, indeed, is {B magnitude} greater than {A magnitude}.
For (then) {C magnitude} would have a lesser ratio to {B magnitude} than (it has) to {A magnitude} [Prop. 5.8].
But it does not.
Thus, {B magnitude} is not greater than {A magnitude}.
And it was shown that (it is) not equal (to {A magnitude}) either.
Thus, {B magnitude} is less than {A magnitude}.

Thus, for (magnitudes) having a ratio to the same (magnitude), that (magnitude which) has the greater ratio is (the) greater.
And that (magnitude) to which the latter (magnitude) has a greater ratio is (the) lesser.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
