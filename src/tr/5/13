If a first (magnitude) has the same ratio to a second that a third (has) to a fourth, and the third (magnitude) has a greater ratio to the fourth than a fifth (has) to a sixth, then the first (magnitude) will also have a greater ratio to the second than the fifth (has) to the sixth.

For let a first (magnitude) {A magnitude} have the same ratio to a second {B magnitude} that a third {C magnitude} (has) to a fourth {D magnitude}, and let the third (magnitude) {C magnitude} have a greater ratio to the fourth {D magnitude} than a fifth {E magnitude} (has) to a sixth {F magnitude}.
I say that the first (magnitude) {A magnitude} will also have a greater ratio to the second {B magnitude} than the fifth {E magnitude} (has) to the sixth {F magnitude}.

For since there are some equal multiples of {C magnitude} and {E magnitude}, and other random equal multiples of {D magnitude} and {F magnitude}, (for which) the multiple of {C magnitude} exceeds the (multiple) of {D magnitude}, and the multiple of {E magnitude} does not exceed the multiple of {F magnitude} [Def. 5.7], let them have been taken.
And let {G magnitude} and {H magnitude} be equal multiples of {C magnitude} and {E magnitude} (respectively), and {K magnitude} and {L magnitude} other random equal multiples of {D magnitude} and {F magnitude} (respectively), such that {G magnitude} exceeds {K magnitude}, but {H magnitude} does not exceed {L magnitude}.
And as many times as {G magnitude} is (divisible) by {C magnitude}, so many times let {M magnitude} be (divisible) by {A magnitude}.
And as many times as {K magnitude} (is divisible) by {D magnitude}, so many times let {N magnitude} be (divisible) by {B magnitude}.

And since as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, and the equal multiples {M magnitude} and {G magnitude} have been taken of {A magnitude} and {C magnitude} (respectively), and the other random equal multiples {N magnitude} and {K magnitude} of {B magnitude} and {D magnitude} (respectively), thus if {M magnitude} exceeds {N magnitude} then {G magnitude} exceeds {K magnitude}, and if ({M magnitude} is) equal (to {N magnitude} then {G magnitude} is also) equal (to {K magnitude}), and if ({M magnitude} is) less (than {N magnitude} then {G magnitude} is also) less (than {K magnitude}) [Def. 5.5].
And {G magnitude} exceeds {K magnitude}.
Thus, {M magnitude} also exceeds {N magnitude}.
And {H magnitude} does not exceeds {L magnitude}.
And {M magnitude} and {H magnitude} are equal multiples of {A magnitude} and {E magnitude} (respectively), and {N magnitude} and {L magnitude} other random equal multiples of {B magnitude} and {F magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, {A magnitude} has a greater ratio to {B magnitude} than {E magnitude} (has) to {F magnitude} [Def. 5.7].

Thus, if a first (magnitude) has the same ratio to a second that a third (has) to a fourth, and a third (magnitude) has a greater ratio to a fourth than a fifth (has) to a sixth, then the first (magnitude) will also have a greater ratio to the second than the fifth (has) to the sixth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
