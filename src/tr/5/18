If separated magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional (when) composed.

Let {AE magnitude}, {EB magnitude}, {CF magnitude}, and {FD magnitude} be separated magnitudes (which are) proportional, (so that) as {AE magnitude} (is) to {EB magnitude}, so {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}.
I say that they will also be proportional (when) composed, (so that) as {AB magnitude} (is) to {BE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}.
For if (it is) not (the case that) as {AB magnitude} is to {BE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}, then it will surely be (the case that) as {AB magnitude} (is) to {BE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} is either to some (magnitude) less than {DF magnitude}, or (some magnitude) greater (than {DF magnitude}).

Let it, first of all, be to (some magnitude) less (than {DF magnitude}), (namely) {DG magnitude}.
And since composed magnitudes are proportional, (so that) as {AB magnitude} is to {BE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} (is) to {DG magnitude}, they will thus also be proportional (when) separated [Prop. 5.17].
Thus, as {AE magnitude} is to {EB magnitude}, so {CG magnitude} (is) to {GD magnitude}.
But it was also assumed that as {AE magnitude} (is) to {EB magnitude}, so {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}.
Thus, (it is) also (the case that) as {CG magnitude} (is) to {GD magnitude}, so {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].
And the first (magnitude) {CG magnitude} (is) greater than the third {CF magnitude}.
Thus, the second (magnitude) {GD magnitude} (is) also greater than the fourth {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.14].
But (it is) also less.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, (it is) not (the case that) as {AB magnitude} is to {BE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} (is) to less than {FD magnitude}.
Similarly, we can show that neither (is it the case) to greater (than {FD magnitude}).
Thus, (it is the case) to the same (as {FD magnitude}).

Thus, if separated magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional (when) composed.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
