If a solid (figure) is contained by (six) parallel planes then its opposite planes are both equal and parallelogrammic.

For let the solid (figure) {CDHG given} have been contained by the parallel planes {AC polygon}, {GF polygon}, and {AH polygon}, {DF polygon}, and {BF polygon}, {AE polygon}.
I say that its opposite planes are both equal and parallelogrammic.

For since the two parallel planes {BG polygon} and {CE polygon} are cut by the plane {AC polygon}, their common sections are parallel [Prop. 11.16].
Thus, {AB line} is parallel to {DC line}.
Again, since the two parallel planes {BF polygon} and {AE polygon} are cut by the plane {AC polygon}, their common sections are parallel [Prop. 11.16].
Thus, {BC line} is parallel to {AD line}.
And {AB line} was also shown (to be) parallel to {DC line}.
Thus, {AC polygon} is a parallelogram.
So, similarly, we can also show that {DF polygon}, {FG polygon}, {GB polygon}, {BF polygon}, and {AE polygon} are each parallelograms.

Let {AH line} and {DF line} have been joined.
And since {AB line} is parallel to {DC line}, and {BH line} to {CF line}, so the two (straight-lines) joining one another, {AB line} and {BH line}, are parallel to the two straight-lines joining one another, {DC line} and {CF line} (respectively), not (being) in the same plane.
Thus, they will contain equal angles [Prop. 11.10].
Thus, angle {ABH angle} (is) equal to (angle) {DCF angle}.
And since the two (straight-lines) {AB line} and {BH line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DC line} and {CF line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.34], and angle {ABH angle} is equal to angle {DCF angle}, the base {AH line} is thus equal to the base {DF line}, and triangle {ABH polygon} is equal to triangle {DCF polygon} [Prop. 1.4].
And parallelogram {BG polygon} is double (triangle) {ABH polygon}, and parallelogram {CE polygon} double (triangle) {DCF polygon} [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, parallelogram {BG polygon} (is) equal to parallelogram {CE polygon}.
So, similarly, we can show that {AC polygon} is also equal to {GF polygon}, and {AE polygon} to {BF polygon}.

Thus, if a solid (figure) is contained by (six) parallel planes then its opposite planes are both equal and parallelogrammic.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
