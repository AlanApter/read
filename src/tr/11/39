If there are two equal height prisms, and one has a parallelogram, and the other a triangle, (as a) base, and the parallelogram is double the triangle, then the prisms will be equal.

Let {ABCDEF given} and {GHKLMN given} be two equal height prisms, and let the former have the parallelogram {AF polygon}, and the latter the triangle {GHK polygon}, as a base.
And let parallelogram {AF polygon} be twice triangle {GHK polygon}.
I say that prism {ABCDEF given} is equal to prism {GHKLMN given}.

For let the solids {AO given} and {GP given} have been completed.
Since parallelogram {AF polygon} is double triangle {GHK polygon}, and parallelogram {HK polygon} is also double triangle {GHK polygon} [Prop. 1.34], parallelogram {AF polygon} is thus equal to parallelogram {HK polygon}.
And parallelepiped solids which are on equal bases, and (have) the same height, are equal to one another [Prop. 11.31].
Thus, solid {AO given} is equal to solid {GP given}.
And prism {ABCDEF given} is half of solid {AO given}, and prism {GHKLMN given} half of solid {GP given} [Prop. 11.28].
Prism {ABCDEF given} is thus equal to prism {GHKLMN given}.

Thus, if there are two equal height prisms, and one has a parallelogram, and the other a triangle, (as a) base, and the parallelogram is double the triangle, then the prisms are equal.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
