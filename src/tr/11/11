To draw a perpendicular straight-line from a given raised point to a given plane.

Let {A point} be the given raised point, and the given plane the reference (plane).
So, it is required to draw a perpendicular straight-line from point {A point} to the reference plane.

Let some random straight-line {BC line} have been drawn across in the reference plane, and let the (straight-line) {AD line} have been drawn from point {A point} perpendicular to {BC line} [Prop. 1.12].
If, therefore, {AD line} is also perpendicular to the reference plane then that which was prescribed will have occurred.
And, if not, let {DE line} have been drawn in the reference plane from point {D point} at right-angles to {BC line} [Prop. 1.11], and let the (straight-line) {AF line} have been drawn from {A point} perpendicular to {DE line} [Prop. 1.12], and let {GH line} have been drawn through point {F point}, parallel to {BC line} [Prop. 1.31].

And since {BC line} is at right-angles to each of {DA line} and {DE line}, {BC line} is thus also at right-angles to the plane through {ED line} and {DA line} [Prop. 11.4].
And {GH line} is parallel to it.
And if two straight-lines are parallel, and one of them is at right-angles to some plane, then the remaining (straight-line) will also be at right-angles to the same plane [Prop. 11.8].
Thus, {GH line} is also at right-angles to the plane through {ED line} and {DA line}.
And {GH line} is thus at right-angles to all of the straight-lines joined to it which are also in the plane through {ED line} and {AD line} [Def. 11.3].
And {AF line}, which is in the plane through {ED line} and {DA line}, is joined to it.
Thus, {GH line} is at right-angles to {FA line}.
Hence, {FA line} is also at right-angles to {HG line}.
And {AF line} is also at right-angles to {DE line}.
Thus, {AF line} is at right-angles to each of {GH line} and {DE line}.
And if a straight-line is set up at right-angles to two straight-lines cutting one another, at the point of section, then it will also be at right-angles to the plane through them [Prop. 11.4].
Thus, {FA line} is at right-angles to the plane through {ED line} and {GH line}.
And the plane through {ED line} and {GH line} is the reference (plane).
Thus, {AF line} is at right-angles to the reference plane.

Thus, the straight-line {AF line} has been drawn from the given raised point {A point} perpendicular to the reference plane.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
