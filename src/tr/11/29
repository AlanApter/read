Parallelepiped solids which are on the same base, and (have) the same height, and in which the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up are on the same straight-lines, are equal to one another.

For let the parallelepiped solids {CM given} and {CN given} be on the same base {AB polygon}, and (have) the same height, and let the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {AG line}, {AF line}, {LM line}, {LN line}, {CD line}, {CE line}, {BH line}, and {BK line}, be on the same straight-lines, {FN line} and {DK line}.
I say that solid {CM given} is equal to solid {CN given}.

For since {CH polygon} and {CK polygon} are each parallelograms, {CB line} is equal to each of {DH line} and {EK line} [Prop. 1.34].
Hence, {DH line} is also equal to {EK line}.
Let {EH line} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remainder {DE line} is equal to the remainder {HK line}.
Hence, triangle {DCE polygon} is also equal to triangle {HBK polygon} [Props. 1.4, 1.8], and parallelogram {DG polygon} to parallelogram {HN polygon} [Prop. 1.36].
So, for the same (reasons), traingle {AFG polygon} is also equal to triangle {MLN polygon}.
And parallelogram {CF polygon} is also equal to parallelogram {BM polygon}, and {CG polygon} to {BN polygon} [Prop. 11.24].
For they are opposite.
Thus, the prism contained by the two triangles {AFG polygon} and {DCE polygon}, and the three parallelograms {AD polygon}, {DG polygon}, and {CG polygon}, is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles {MLN polygon} and {HBK polygon}, and the three parallelograms {BM polygon}, {HN polygon}, and {BN polygon}.
Let the solid whose base (is) parallelogram {AB polygon}, and (whose) opposite (face is) {GEHM polygon}, have been added to both (prisms).
Thus, the whole parallelepiped solid {CM given} is equal to the whole parallelepiped solid {CN given}.

Thus, parallelepiped solids which are on the same base, and (have) the same height, and in which the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up (are) on the same straight-lines, are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
