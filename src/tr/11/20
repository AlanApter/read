If a solid angle is contained by three plane angles then (the sum of) any two (angles) is greater than the remaining (one), (the angles) being taken up in any (possible way).

For let the solid angle {A given} have been contained by the three plane angles {BAC angle}, {CAD angle}, and {DAB angle}.
I say that (the sum of) any two of the angles {BAC angle}, {CAD angle}, and {DAB angle} is greater than the remaining (one), (the angles) being taken up in any (possible way).

For if the angles {BAC angle}, {CAD angle}, and {DAB angle} are equal to one another then (it is) clear that (the sum of) any two is greater than the remaining (one).
But, if not, let {BAC angle} be greater (than {CAD angle} or {DAB angle}).
And let (angle) {BAE angle}, equal to the angle {DAB angle}, have been constructed in the plane through {BAC polygon}, on the straight-line {AB line}, at the point {A point} on it.
And let {AE line} be made equal to {AD line}. And {BEC line} being drawn across through point {E point}, let it cut the straight-lines {AB line} and {AC line} at points {B point} and {C point} (respectively).
And let {DB line} and {DC line} have been joined.

And since {DA line} is equal to {AE line}, and {AB line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines {AD line} and {AB line} are) equal to the two (straight-lines {EA line} and {AB line}, respectively).
And angle {DAB angle} (is) equal to angle {BAE angle}.
Thus, the base {DB line} is equal to the base {BE line} [Prop. 1.4].
And since the (sum of the) two (straight-lines) {BD line} and {DC line} is greater than {BC line} [Prop. 1.20], of which {DB line} was shown (to be) equal to {BE line}, the remainder {DC line} is thus greater than the remainder {EC line}.
And since {DA line} is equal to {AE line}, but {AC line} (is) common, and the base {DC line} is greater than the base {EC line}, the angle {DAC angle} is thus greater than the angle {EAC angle} [Prop. 1.25].
And {DAB angle} was also shown (to be) equal to {BAE angle}.
Thus, (the sum of) {DAB angle} and {DAC angle} is greater than {BAC angle}.
So, similarly, we can also show that the remaining (angles), being taken in pairs, are greater than the remaining (one).

Thus, if a solid angle is contained by three plane angles then (the sum of) any two (angles) is greater than the remaining (one), (the angles) being taken up in any (possible way).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
