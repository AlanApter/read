If two planes cutting one another are at right-angles to some plane then their common section will also be at right-angles to the same plane.

For let the two planes {AB polygon} and {BC polygon} be at right-angles to a reference plane, and let their common section be {BD line}.
I say that {BD line} is at right-angles to the reference plane.

For (if) not, let {DE line} also have been drawn from point {D point}, in the plane {AB polygon}, at right-angles to the straight-line {AD line}, and {DF line}, in the plane {BC polygon}, at right-angles to {CD line}.

And since the plane {AB polygon} is at right-angles to the reference (plane), and {DE line} has been drawn at right-angles to their common section {AD line}, in the plane {AB polygon}, {DE line} is thus at right-angles to the reference plane [Def. 11.4].
So, similarly, we can show that {DF line} is also at right-angles to the reference plane.
Thus, two (different) straight-lines are set up, at the same point {D point}, at right-angles to the reference plane, on the same side.
The very thing is impossible [Prop. 11.13].
Thus, no (other straight-line) except the common section {DB line} of the planes {AB polygon} and {BC polygon} can be set up at point {D point}, at right-angles to the reference plane.

Thus, if two planes cutting one another are at right-angles to some plane then their common section will also be at right-angles to the same plane.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
