Parallelepiped solids which (have) the same height are to one another as their bases.

Let {AB given} and {CD given} be parallelepiped solids (having) the same height.
I say that the parallelepiped solids {AB given} and {CD given} are to one another as their bases.
That is to say, as base {AE polygon} is to base {CF polygon}, so solid {AB given} (is) to solid {CD given}.

For let {FH polygon}, equal to {AE polygon}, have been applied to {FG line} (in the angle {FGH angle} equal to angle {LCG angle}) [Prop. 1.45].
And let the parallelepiped solid {GK given}, (having) the same height as {CD given}, have been completed on the base {FH polygon}.
So solid {AB given} is equal to solid {GK given}.
For they are on the equal bases {AE polygon} and {FH polygon}, and (have) the same height [Prop. 11.31].
And since the parallelepiped solid {CK given} has been cut by the plane {DG polygon}, which is parallel to the opposite planes (of {CK given}), thus as the base {CF polygon} is to the base {FH polygon}, so the solid {CD given} (is) to the solid {DH given} [Prop. 11.25].
And base {FH polygon} (is) equal to base {AE polygon}, and solid {GK given} to solid {AB given}.
And thus as base {AE polygon} is to base {CF polygon}, so solid {AB given} (is) to solid {CD given}.

Thus, parallelepiped solids which (have) the same height are to one another as their bases.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
