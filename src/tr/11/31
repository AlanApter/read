Parallelepiped solids which are on equal bases, and (have) the same height, are equal to one another.

Let the parallelepiped solids {AE given} and {CF given} be on the equal bases {AB polygon} and {CD polygon} (respectively), and (have) the same height.
I say that solid {AE given} is equal to solid {CF given}.

{figure 1}So, let the (straight-lines) standing up, {HK line}, {BE line}, {AG line}, {LM line}, {PQ line}, {DF line}, {CO line}, and {RS line}, first of all, be at right-angles to the bases {AB polygon} and {CD polygon}.
And let {RT line} have been produced in a straight-line with {CR line}.
And let (angle) {TRU angle}, equal to angle {ALB angle}, have been constructed on the straight-line {RT line}, at the point {R point} on it [Prop. 1.23].
And let {RT line} be made equal to {AL line}, and {RU line} to {LB line}.
And let the base {RW polygon}, and the solid {XU given}, have been completed.

And since the two (straight-lines) {TR line} and {RU line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {AL line} and {LB line} (respectively), and they contain equal angles, parallelogram {RW polygon} is thus equal and similar to parallelogram {HL polygon} [Prop. 6.14].
And, again, since {AL line} is equal to {RT line}, and {LM line} to {RS line}, and they contain right-angles, parallelogram {RX polygon} is thus equal and similar to parallelogram {AM polygon} [Prop. 6.14].
So, for the same (reasons), {LE polygon} is also equal and similar to {SU polygon}.
Thus, three parallelograms of solid {AE given} are equal and similar to three parallelograms of solid {XU given}.
But, the three (faces of the former solid) are equal and similar to the three opposite (faces), and the three (faces of the latter solid) to the three opposite (faces) [Prop. 11.24].
Thus, the whole parallelepiped solid {AE given} is equal to the whole parallelepiped solid {XU given} [Def. 11.10].
Let {DR line} and {WU line} have been drawn across, and let them have met one another at {Y point}.
And let {aTb line} have been drawn through {T line} parallel to {DY line}.
And let {PD line} have been produced to {a point}.
And let the solids {YX given} and {RI given} have been completed.
So, solid {XY given}, whose base is parallelogram {RX polygon}, and opposite (face) {Yc polygon}, is equal to solid {XU given}, whose base (is) parallelogram {RX polygon}, and opposite (face) {UV polygon}.
For they are on the same base {RX polygon}, and (have) the same height, and the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {RY line}, {RU line}, {Tb line}, {TW line}, {Se line}, {Sd line}, {Xc line} and {XV line}, are on the same straight-lines, {YW line} and {eV line} [Prop. 11.29].
But, solid {XU given} is equal to {AE given}.
Thus, solid {XY given} is also equal to solid {AE given}.
And since parallelogram {RUWT polygon} is equal to parallelogram {YT polygon}.
For they are on the same base {RT line}, and between the same parallels {RT line} and {YW line} [Prop. 1.35].
But, {RUWT polygon} is equal to {CD polygon}, since (it is) also (equal) to {AB polygon}.
Parallelogram {YT polygon} is thus also equal to {CD polygon}.
And {DT polygon} is another (parallelogram).
Thus, as base {CD polygon} is to {DT polygon}, so {YT polygon} (is) to {DT polygon} [Prop. 5.7].
And since the parallelepiped solid {CI given} has been cut by the plane {RF polygon}, which is parallel to the opposite planes (of {CI given}), as base {CD polygon} is to base {DT polygon}, so solid {CF given} (is) to solid {RI given} [Prop. 11.25].
So, for the same (reasons), since the parallelepiped solid {YI given} has been cut by the plane {RX polygon}, which is parallel to the opposite planes (of {YI given}), as base {YT polygon} is to base {TD polygon}, so solid {YX given} (is) to solid {RI given} [Prop. 11.25].
But, as base {CD polygon} (is) to {DT polygon}, so {YT polygon} (is) to {DT polygon}.
And, thus, as solid {CF given} (is) to solid {RI given}, so solid {YX given} (is) to solid {RI given}.
Thus, solids {CF given} and {YX given} each have the same ratio to {RI given} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, solid {CF given} is equal to solid {YX given} [Prop. 5.9].
But, {YX given} was show (to be) equal to {AE given}.
Thus, {AE given} is also equal to {CF given}.

{figure 2}And so let the (straight-lines) standing up, {AG line}, {HK line}, {BE line}, {LM line}, {CO line}, {PQ line}, {DF line}, and {RS line}, not be at right-angles to the bases {AB polygon} and {CD polygon}.
Again, I say that solid {AE given} (is) equal to solid {CF given}.
For let {KN line}, {ET line}, {GU line}, {MV line}, {QW line}, {FX line}, {OY line}, and {SI line} have been drawn from points {K point}, {E point}, {G point}, {M point}, {Q point}, {F point}, {O point}, and {S point} (respectively) perpendicular to the reference plane (i.e., the plane of the bases {AB polygon} and {CD polygon}), and let them have met the plane at points {N point}, {T point}, {U point}, {V point}, {W point}, {X point}, {Y point}, and {I point} (respectively).
And let {NT line}, {NU line}, {UV line}, {TV line}, {WX line}, {WY line}, {YI line}, and {IX line} have been joined.
So solid {KV given} is equal to solid {QI given}.
For they are on the equal bases {KM polygon} and {QS polygon}, and (have) the same height, and the (straight-lines) standing up in them are at right-angles to their bases (see first part of proposition).
But, solid {KV given} is equal to solid {AE given}, and {QI given} to {CF given}.
For they are on the same base, and (have) the same height, and the (straight-lines) standing up in them are not on the same straight-lines [Prop. 11.30].
Thus, solid {AE given} is also equal to solid {CF given}.

Thus, parallelepiped solids which are on equal bases, and (have) the same height, are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
