Cones and cylinders which are on equal bases are to one another as their heights.

For let {EB given} and {FD given} be cylinders on equal bases, (namely) the circles {AB given} and {CD given} (respectively).
I say that as cylinder {EB given} is to cylinder {FD given}, so axis {GH line} (is) to axis {KL line}.

For let the axis {KL line} have been produced to point {N point}.
And let {LN line} be made equal to axis {GH line}.
And let the cylinder {CM given} have been conceived about axis {LN line}.
Therefore, since cylinders {EB given} and {CM given} have the same height they are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.11].
And the bases are equal to one another.
Thus, cylinders {EB given} and {CM given} are also equal to one another.
And since cylinder {FM given} has been cut by the plane {CD given}, which is parallel to its opposite planes, thus as cylinder {CM given} is to cylinder {FD given}, so axis {LN line} (is) to axis {KL line} [Prop. 12.13].
And cylinder {CM given} is equal to cylinder {EB given}, and axis {LN line} to axis {GH line}.
Thus, as cylinder {EB given} is to cylinder {FD given}, so axis {GH line} (is) to axis {KL line}.
And as cylinder {EB given} (is) to cylinder {FD given}, so cone {ABG given} (is) to cone {CDK given} [Prop. 12.10].
Thus, also, as axis {GH line} (is) to axis {KL line}, so cone {ABG given} (is) to cone {CDK given}, and cylinder {EB given} to cylinder {FD given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
