The bases of equal cones and cylinders are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
And, those cones and cylinders whose bases (are) reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal.

Let there be equal cones and cylinders whose bases are the circles {ABCD given} and {EFGH given}, and the diameters of (the bases) {AC line} and {EG line}, and (whose) axes (are) {KL line} and {MN line}, which are also the heights of the cones and cylinders (respectively).
And let the cylinders {AO given} and {EP given} have been completed.
I say that the bases of cylinders {AO given} and {EP given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (so) as base {ABCD given} is to base {EFGH given}, so height {MN line} (is) to height {KL line}.

For height {LK line} is either equal to height {MN line}, or not.
Let it, first of all, be equal.
And cylinder {AO given} is also equal to cylinder {EP given}.
And cones and cylinders having the same height are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.11].
Thus, base {ABCD given} (is) also equal to base {EFGH given}.
And, hence, reciprocally, as base {ABCD given} (is) to base {EFGH given}, so height {MN line} (is) to height {KL line}.
And so, let height {LK line} not be equal to {MN line}, but let {MN line} be greater.
And let {QN line}, equal to {KL line}, have been cut off from height {MN line}.
And let the cylinder {EP given} have been cut, through point {Q point}, by the plane {TUS given} (which is) parallel to the planes of the circles {EFGH given} and {RP given}.
And let cylinder {ES given} have been conceived, with base the circle {EFGH given}, and height {NQ line}.
And since cylinder {AO given} is equal to cylinder {EP given}, thus, as cylinder {AO given} (is) to cylinder {ES given}, so cylinder {EP given} (is) to cylinder {ES given} [Prop. 5.7].
But, as cylinder {AO given} (is) to cylinder {ES given}, so base {ABCD given} (is) to base {EFGH given}.
For cylinders {AO given} and {ES given} (have) the same height [Prop. 12.11].
And as cylinder {EP given} (is) to (cylinder) {ES given}, so height {MN line} (is) to height {QN line}.
For cylinder {EP given} has been cut by a plane which is parallel to its opposite planes [Prop. 12.13].
And, thus, as base {ABCD given} is to base {EFGH given}, so height {MN line} (is) to height {QN line} [Prop. 5.11].
And height {QN line} (is) equal to height {KL line}.
Thus, as base {ABCD given} is to base {EFGH given}, so height {MN line} (is) to height {KL line}.
Thus, the bases of cylinders {AO given} and {EP given} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.

And, so, let the bases of cylinders {AO given} and {EP given} be reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (thus) let base {ABCD given} be to base {EFGH given}, as height {MN line} (is) to height {KL line}.
I say that cylinder {AO given} is equal to cylinder {EP given}.

For, with the same construction, since as base {ABCD given} is to base {EFGH given}, so height {MN line} (is) to height {KL line}, and height {KL line} (is) equal to height {QN line}, thus, as base {ABCD given} (is) to base {EFGH given}, so height {MN line} will be to height {QN line}.
But, as base {ABCD given} (is) to base {EFGH given}, so cylinder {AO given} (is) to cylinder {ES given}.
For they are the same height [Prop. 12.11].
And as height {MN line} (is) to [height] {QN line}, so cylinder {EP given} (is) to cylinder {ES given} [Prop. 12.13].
Thus, as cylinder {AO given} is to cylinder {ES given}, so cylinder {EP given} (is) to (cylinder) {ES given} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, cylinder {AO given} (is) equal to cylinder {EP given} [Prop. 5.9].
In the same manner, (the proposition can) also (be demonstrated) for the cones.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
