Pyramids which are of the same height, and have triangular bases, are to one another as their bases.

Let there be pyramids of the same height whose bases (are) the triangles {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon}, and apexes the points {G point} and {H point} (respectively).
I say that as base {ABC polygon} is to base {DEF polygon}, so pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to pyramid {DEFH given}.

For if base {ABC polygon} is not to base {DEF polygon}, as pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to pyramid {DEFH given}, then base {ABC polygon} will be to base {DEF polygon}, as pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to some solid either less than, or greater than, pyramid {DEFH given}.
Let it, first of all, be (in this ratio) to (some) lesser (solid), {W given}.
And let pyramid {DEFH given} have been divided into two pyramids equal to one another, and similar to the whole, and into two equal prisms.
So, the (sum of the) two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyramid [Prop. 12.3].
And, again, let the pyramids generated by the division have been similarly divided, and let this be done continually until some pyramids are left from pyramid {DEFH given} which (when added together) are less than the excess by which pyramid {DEFH given} exceeds the solid {W given} [Prop. 10.1].
Let them have been left, and, for the sake of argument, let them be {DQRS given} and {STUH given}.
Thus, the (sum of the) remaining prisms within pyramid {DEFH given} is greater than solid {W given}.
Let pyramid {ABCG given} also have been divided similarly, and a similar number of times, as pyramid {DEFH given}.
Thus, as base {ABC polygon} is to base {DEF polygon}, so the (sum of the) prisms within pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to the (sum of the) prisms within pyramid {DEFH given} [Prop. 12.4].
But, also, as base {ABC polygon} (is) to base {DEF polygon}, so pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to solid {W given}.
And, thus, as pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to solid {W given}, so the (sum of the) prisms within pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to the (sum of the) prisms within pyramid {DEFH given} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, alternately, as pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to the (sum of the) prisms within it, so solid {W given} (is) to the (sum of the) prisms within pyramid {DEFH given} [Prop. 5.16].
And pyramid {ABCG given} (is) greater than the (sum of the) prisms within it.
Thus, solid {W given} (is) also greater than the (sum of the) prisms within pyramid {DEFH given} [Prop. 5.14].
But, (it is) also less.
This very thing is impossible.
Thus, as base {ABC polygon} is to base {DEF polygon}, so pyramid {ABCG given} (is) not to some solid less than pyramid {DEFH given}.
So, similarly, we can show that base {DEF polygon} is not to base {ABC polygon}, as pyramid {DEFH given} (is) to some solid less than pyramid {ABCG given} either.

So, I say that neither is base {ABC polygon} to base {DEF polygon}, as pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to some solid greater than pyramid {DEFH given}.

For, if possible, let it be (in this ratio) to some greater (solid), {W given}.
Thus, inversely, as base {DEF polygon} (is) to base {ABC polygon}, so solid {W given} (is) to pyramid {ABCG given} [Prop. 5.7. corr.].
And as solid {W given} (is) to pyramid {ABCG given}, so pyramid {DEFH given} (is) to some (solid) less than pyramid {ABCG given}, as shown before [Prop. 12.2 lem.].
And, thus, as base {DEF polygon} (is) to base {ABC polygon}, so pyramid {DEFH given} (is) to some (solid) less than pyramid {ABCG given} [Prop. 5.11].
The very thing was shown (to be) absurd.
Thus, base {ABC polygon} is not to base {DEF polygon}, as pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to some solid greater than pyramid {DEFH given}.
And, it was shown that neither (is it in this ratio) to a lesser (solid).
Thus, as base {ABC polygon} is to base {DEF polygon}, so pyramid {ABCG given} (is) to pyramid {DEFH given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
