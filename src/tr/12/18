Spheres are to one another in the cubed ratio of their respective diameters.

Let the spheres {ABC circle b} and {DEF circle e} have been conceived, and (let) their diameters (be) {BC line} and {EF line} (respectively).
I say that sphere {ABC circle b} has to sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.

For if sphere {ABC circle b} does not have to sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line} then sphere {ABC circle b} will have to some (sphere) either less than, or greater than, sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.
Let it, first of all, have (such a ratio) to a lesser (sphere), {GHK circle e}.
And let {DEF circle e} have been conceived about the same center as {GHK circle e}.
And let a polyhedral solid have been inscribed in the greater sphere {DEF circle e}, not touching the lesser sphere {GHK circle e} on its surface [Prop. 12.17].
And let a polyhedral solid, similar to the polyhedral solid in sphere {DEF circle e}, have also been inscribed in sphere {ABC circle b}.
Thus, the polyhedral solid in sphere {ABC circle b} has to the polyhedral solid in sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line} [Prop. 12.17 corr.].
And sphere {ABC circle b} also has to sphere {GHK circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.
Thus, as sphere {ABC circle b} is to sphere {GHK circle e}, so the polyhedral solid in sphere {ABC circle b} (is) to the polyhedral solid in sphere {DEF circle e}.
[Thus], alternately, as sphere {ABC circle b} (is) to the polyhedral solid within it, so sphere {GHK circle e} (is) to the polyhedral solid within sphere {DEF circle e} [Prop. 5.16].
And sphere {ABC circle b} (is) greater than the polyhedron within it.
Thus, sphere {GHK circle e} (is) also greater than the polyhedron within sphere {DEF circle e} [Prop. 5.14].
But, (it is) also less.
For it is encompassed by it.
Thus, sphere {ABC circle b} does not have to (a sphere) less than sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that diameter {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.
So, similarly, we can show that sphere {DEF circle e} does not have to (a sphere) less than sphere {ABC circle b} the cubed ratio that {EF line} (has) to {BC line} either.

So, I say that sphere {ABC circle b} does not have to some (sphere) greater than sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line} either.

For, if possible, let it have (the cubed ratio) to a greater (sphere), {LMN circle m}.
Thus, inversely, sphere {LMN circle m} (has) to sphere {ABC circle b} the cubed ratio that diameter {EF line} (has) to diameter {BC line} [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
And as sphere {LMN circle m} (is) to sphere {ABC circle b}, so sphere {DEF circle e} (is) to some (sphere) less than sphere {ABC circle b}, inasmuch as {LMN circle m} is greater than {DEF circle e}, as was shown before [Prop. 12.2 lem.].
And, thus, sphere {DEF circle e} has to some (sphere) less than sphere {ABC circle b} the cubed ratio that {EF line} (has) to {BC line}.
The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
Thus, sphere {ABC circle b} does not have to some (sphere) greater than sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.
And it was shown that neither (does it have such a ratio) to a lesser (sphere).
Thus, sphere {ABC circle b} has to sphere {DEF circle e} the cubed ratio that {BC line} (has) to {EF line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
