A binomial (straight-line) can be divided into its (component) terms at one point only.

Let {AB magnitude} be a binomial (straight-line) which has been divided into its (component) terms at {C point}.
{AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.36].
I say that {AB magnitude} cannot be divided at another point into two rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.

For, if possible, let it also have been divided at {D point}, such that {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are also rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
So, (it is) clear that {AC magnitude} is not the same as {DB magnitude}.
For, if possible, let it be (the same).
So, {AD magnitude} will also be the same as {CB magnitude}.
And as {AC magnitude} will be to {CB magnitude}, so {BD magnitude} (will be) to {DA magnitude}.
And {AB magnitude} will (thus) also be divided at {D point} in the same (manner) as the division at {C point}.
The very opposite was assumed.
Thus, {AC magnitude} is not the same as {DB magnitude}.
So, on account of this, points {C point} and {D point} are not equally far from the point of bisection.
Thus, by whatever (amount the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} also differs from twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by this (same amount)---on account of both (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, plus twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, and (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}, plus twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}, being equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude} [Prop. 2.4].
But, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} by a rational (area).
For (they are) both rational (areas).
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} also differs from twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area, despite both) being medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].
The very thing is absurd.
For a medial (area) cannot exceed a medial (area) by a rational (area) [Prop. 10.26].

Thus, a binomial (straight-line) cannot be divided (into its component terms) at different points.
Thus, (it can be so divided) at one point only.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
