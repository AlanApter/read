A (straight-line) commensurable in length with a binomial (straight-line) is itself also binomial, and the same in order.

Let {AB magnitude} be a binomial (straight-line), and let {CD magnitude} be commensurable in length with {AB magnitude}.
I say that {CD magnitude} is a binomial (straight-line), and (is) the same in order as {AB magnitude}.

For since {AB magnitude} is a binomial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at {E point}, and let {AE magnitude} be the greater term.
{AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.36].
Let it have been contrived that as {AB magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude}, so {AE magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude} [Prop. 6.12].
Thus, the remainder {EB magnitude} is also to the remainder {FD magnitude}, as {AB magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude} [Props. 6.16, 5.19 corr.].
And {AB magnitude} (is) commensurable in length with {CD magnitude}.
Thus, {AE magnitude} is also commensurable (in length) with {CF magnitude}, and {EB magnitude} with {FD magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
And {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are rational.
Thus, {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are also rational.
And as {AE magnitude} is to {CF magnitude}, (so) {EB magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, alternately, as {AE magnitude} is to {EB magnitude}, (so) {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].
And {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} [are] commensurable in square only.
Thus, {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].
And they are rational.
{CD magnitude} is thus a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that it is the same in order as {AB magnitude}.

For the square on {AE magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {EB magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) either commensurable or incommensurable (in length) with ({AE magnitude}).
Therefore, if the square on {AE magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {EB magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE magnitude}) then the square on {CF magnitude} will also be greater than (the square on) {FD magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({CF magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].
And if {AE magnitude} is commensurable (in length) with (some previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then {CF magnitude} will also be commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.12].
And, on account of this, {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are each first binomial (straight-lines) [Def. 10.5]---that is to say, the same in order.
And if {EB magnitude} is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then {FD magnitude} is also commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.12], and, again, on account of this, ({CD magnitude}) will be the same in order as {AB magnitude}.
For each of them will be second binomial (straight-lines) [Def. 10.6].
And if neither of {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then neither of {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} will be commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.13], and each (of {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}) is a third (binomial straight-line) [Def. 10.7].
And if the square on {AE magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {EB magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({AE magnitude}) then the square on {CF magnitude} is also greater than (the square on) {FD magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({CF magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].
And if {AE magnitude} is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then {CF magnitude} is also commensurable (in length) with it [Prop. 10.12], and each (of {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}) is a fourth (binomial straight-line) [Def. 10.8].
And if {EB magnitude} (is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straight-line) then {FD magnitude} (is) also (commensurable in length with it), and each (of {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}) will be a fifth (binomial straight-line) [Def. 10.9].
And if neither of {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straight-line) then also neither of {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} is commensurable (in length) with the laid down rational (straight-line), and each (of {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}) will be a sixth (binomial straight-line) [Def. 10.10].

Hence, a (straight-line) commensurable in length with a binomial (straight-line) is a binomial (straight-line), and the same in order.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
