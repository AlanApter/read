The (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a first apotome as breadth.

Let {AB magnitude} be an apotome, and {CD line} a rational (straight-line).
And let {CE polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CF line} as breadth.
I say that {CF line} is a first apotome.

For let {BG magnitude} be an attachment to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And let {CH polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and {KL polygon}, (equal) to the (square) on {BG magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}.
Thus, the whole of {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, of which {CE polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}.
The remainder {FL polygon} is thus equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].
Let {FM line} have been cut in half at point {N point}.
And let {NO line} have been drawn through {N point}, parallel to {CD line}.
Thus, {FO polygon} and {LN polygon} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
And since the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is rational, and {DM polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {DM polygon} is thus rational.
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD line}, producing {CM line} as breadth.
Thus, {CM line} is rational, and commensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.20].
Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is medial, and {FL polygon} (is) equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {FL polygon} (is) thus a medial (area).
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD line}, producing {FM line} as breadth.
{FM line} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} medial, the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
And {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, and {FL polygon} to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.
{DM polygon} is thus incommensurable with {FL polygon}.
And as {DM polygon} (is) to {FL polygon}, so {CM line} is to {FM line} [Prop. 6.1].
{CM line} is thus incommensurable in length with {FM line} [Prop. 10.11].
And both are rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {CM line} and {MF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF line} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a first (apotome).

For since the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is the mean proportional to the (squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and {CH polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and {KL polygon} equal to the (square) on {BG magnitude}, and {NL polygon} to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {NL polygon} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH polygon} and {KL polygon}.
Thus, as {CH polygon} is to {NL polygon}, so {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}.
But, as {CH polygon} (is) to {NL polygon}, so {CK line} is to {NM line}, and as {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {NM line} is to {KM line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line} is equal to the (square) on {NM line}---that is to say, to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line} [Prop. 6.17].
And since the (square) on {AG magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {GB magnitude}, {CH polygon} [is] also commensurable with {KL polygon}.
And as {CH polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {CK line} (is) to {KM line} [Prop. 6.1].
{CK line} is thus commensurable (in length) with {KM line} [Prop. 10.11].
Therefore, since {CM line} and {MF line} are two unequal straight-lines, and the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line}, equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line}, has been applied to {CM line}, falling short by a square figure, and {CK line} is commensurable (in length) with {KM line}, the square on {CM line} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({CM line}) [Prop. 10.17].
And {CM line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD line}.
Thus, {CF line} is a first apotome [Def. 10.15].

Thus, the (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a first apotome as breadth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
