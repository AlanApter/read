If two medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, which contain a rational (area), are added together then the whole (straight-line) is irrational---let it be called a first bimedial (straight-line).

For let the two medial (straight-lines), {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, commensurable in square only, (and) containing a rational (area), be laid down together.
I say that the whole (straight-line), {AC magnitude}, is irrational.

For since {AB magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {BC magnitude}, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is thus also incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [see previous proposition].
And, via composition, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, plus twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}---that is, the (square) on {AC magnitude} [Prop. 2.4]---is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.16].
And the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) rational---for {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} were assumed to enclose a rational (area).
Thus, the (square) on {AC magnitude} (is) irrational.
Thus, {AC magnitude} (is) irrational [Def. 10.4]---let it be called a first bimedial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
