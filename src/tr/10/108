A medial (area) being subtracted from a rational (area), one of two irrational (straight-lines) arise (as) the square-root of the remaining area---either an apotome, or a minor (straight-line).

For let the medial (area) {BD polygon} have been subtracted from the rational (area) {BC polygon}.
I say that one of two irrational (straight-lines) arise (as) the square-root of the remaining (area), {EC polygon}---either an apotome, or a minor (straight-line).

For let the rational (straight-line) {FG line} have been laid out, and let the right-angled parallelogram {GH polygon}, equal to {BC polygon}, have been applied to {FG line}, and let {GK polygon}, equal to {DB polygon}, have been subtracted (from {GH polygon}).
Thus, the remainder {EC polygon} is equal to {LH polygon}.
Therefore, since {BC polygon} is a rational (area), and {BD polygon} a medial (area), and {BC polygon} (is) equal to {GH polygon}, and {BD polygon} to {GK polygon}, {GH polygon} is thus a rational (area), and {GK polygon} a medial (area).
And they are applied to the rational (straight-line) {FG line}.
Thus, {FH line} (is) rational, and commensurable in length with {FG line} [Prop. 10.20], and {FK line} (is) also rational, and incommensurable in length with {FG line} [Prop. 10.22].
Thus, {FH line} is incommensurable in length with {FK line} [Prop. 10.13].
{FH line} and {FK line} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {KH line} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73], and {KF line} an attachment to it.
So, the square on {HF line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} by the (square) on (some straightline which is) either commensurable, or not (commensurable), (in length with {HF line}).

First, let the square (on it) be (greater) by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) commensurable (in length with {HF line}).
And the whole of {HF line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {FG line}.
Thus, {KH line} is a first apotome [Def. 10.1].
And the square-root of an (area) contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first apotome is an apotome [Prop. 10.91].
Thus, the square-root of {LH polygon}---that is to say, (of) {EC polygon}---is an apotome.

And if the square on {HF line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({HF line}), and (since) the whole of {FH line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {FG line}, {KH line} is a fourth apotome [Prop. 10.14].
And the square-root of an (area) contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth apotome is a minor (straight-line) [Prop. 10.94].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
