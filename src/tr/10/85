To find a first apotome.

Let the rational (straight-line) {A magnitude} be laid down.
And let {BG magnitude} be commensurable in length with {A magnitude}.
{BG magnitude} is thus also a rational (straight-line).
And let two square numbers {DE magnitude} and {EF magnitude} be laid down, and let their difference {FD magnitude} be not square [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
Thus, {ED magnitude} does not have to {DF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let it have been contrived that as {ED magnitude} (is) to {DF magnitude}, so the square on {BG magnitude} (is) to the square on {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.6. corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {BG magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And the (square) on {BG magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {GC magnitude} (is) also rational.
Thus, {GC magnitude} is also rational.
And since {ED magnitude} does not have to {DF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {BG magnitude} thus does not have to the (square) on {GC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {BG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {BG magnitude} and {GC magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {BC magnitude} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a first (apotome).

Let the (square) on {H magnitude} be that (area) by which the (square) on {BG magnitude} is greater than the (square) on {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.13 lem.].
And since as {ED magnitude} is to {FD magnitude}, so the (square) on {BG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GC magnitude}, thus, via conversion, as {DE magnitude} is to {EF magnitude}, so the (square) on {GB magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {H magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {DE magnitude} has to {EF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square-number (has) to (some) square-number.
For each is a square (number).
Thus, the (square) on {GB magnitude} also has to the (square) on {H magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, {BG magnitude} is commensurable in length with {H magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And the square on {BG magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GC magnitude} by the (square) on {H magnitude}.
Thus, the square on {BG magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GC magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({BG magnitude}).
And the whole, {BG magnitude}, is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {A magnitude}.
Thus, {BC magnitude} is a first apotome [Def. 10.11].

Thus, the first apotome {BC magnitude} has been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to find.
