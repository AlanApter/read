To find a fifth binomial straight-line.

Let the two numbers {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} be laid down such that {AB magnitude} does not have to either of them the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let some rational straight-line {D magnitude} be laid down.
And let {EF magnitude} be commensurable [in length] with {D magnitude}.
Thus, {EF magnitude} (is) a rational (straight-line).
And let it have been contrived that as {CA magnitude} (is) to {AB magnitude}, so the (square) on {EF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
And {CA magnitude} does not have to {AB magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {EF magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {FG magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF magnitude} and {FG magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, {EG magnitude} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that (it is) also a fifth (binomial straight-line).

For since as {CA magnitude} is to {AB magnitude}, so the (square) on {EF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude}, inversely, as {BA magnitude} (is) to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FE magnitude} [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {GF magnitude} (is) greater than the (square) on {FE magnitude} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on {EF magnitude} and {H magnitude} be equal to the (square) on {GF magnitude}.
Thus, via conversion, as the number {AB magnitude} is to {BC magnitude}, so the (square) on {GF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {H magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {AB magnitude} does not have to {BC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {FG magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {H magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {FG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {H magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Hence, the square on {FG magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {FE magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({FG magnitude}).
And {GF magnitude} and {FE magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And the lesser term {EF magnitude} is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line previously) laid down, {D magnitude}.

Thus, {EG magnitude} is a fifth binomial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
