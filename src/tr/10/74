If a medial (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and which contains a rational (area) with the whole, is subtracted from a(nother) medial (straight-line) then the remainder is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called a first apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For let the medial (straight-line) {BC magnitude}, which is commensurable in square only with {AB magnitude}, and which makes with {AB magnitude} the rational (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, have been subtracted from the medial (straight-line) {AB magnitude} [Prop. 10.27].
I say that the remainder {AC magnitude} is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called the first apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For since {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are medial (straight-lines), the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is also medial.
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) rational.
The (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}.
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is also incommensurable with the remaining (square) on {AC magnitude} [Prop. 2.7], since if the whole is incommensurable with one of the (constituent magnitudes) then the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable (with one another) [Prop. 10.16].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {AC magnitude} is irrational.
Thus, {AC magnitude} is an irrational (straight-line) [Def. 10.4].
Let it be called a first apotome of a medial (straight-line).
