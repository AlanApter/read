If the remainder of two unequal magnitudes (which are) [laid out] never measures the (magnitude) before it, (when) the lesser (magnitude is) continually subtracted in turn from the greater, then the (original) magnitudes will be incommensurable.

For, {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude} being two unequal magnitudes, and {AB magnitude} (being) the lesser, let the remainder never measure the (magnitude) before it, (when) the lesser (magnitude is) continually subtracted in turn from the greater.
I say that the magnitudes {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are incommensurable.

For if they are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them (both).
If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be {E magnitude}.
And let {AB magnitude} leave {CF magnitude} less than itself (in) measuring {FD magnitude}, and let {CF magnitude} leave {AG magnitude} less than itself (in) measuring {BG magnitude}, and let this happen continually, until some magnitude which is less than {E magnitude} is left.
Let (this) have occurred, and let {AG magnitude}, (which is) less than {E magnitude}, have been left.
Therefore, since {E magnitude} measures {AB magnitude}, but {AB magnitude} measures {DF magnitude}, {E magnitude} will thus also measure {FD magnitude}.
And it also measures the whole (of) {CD magnitude}.
Thus, it will also measure the remainder {CF magnitude}.
But, {CF magnitude} measures {BG magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} also measures {BG magnitude}.
And it also measures the whole (of) {AB magnitude}.
Thus, it will also measure the remainder {AG magnitude}, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) the magnitudes {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}.
Thus, the magnitudes {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are incommensurable [Def. 10.1].

Thus, if ...of two unequal magnitudes, and so on ....
