Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be commensurable magnitudes.
I say that {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.

For if {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are commensurable (magnitudes) then some magnitude will measure them.
Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be {C magnitude}.
And as many times as {C magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, so many units let there be in {D magnitude}.
And as many times as {C magnitude} measures {B magnitude}, so many units let there be in {E magnitude}.

Therefore, since {C magnitude} measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {D magnitude}, and a unit also measures {D magnitude} according to the units in it, a unit thus measures the number {D magnitude} as many times as the magnitude {C magnitude} (measures) {A magnitude}.
Thus, as {C magnitude} is to {A magnitude}, so a unit (is) to {D magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
Thus, inversely, as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to a unit [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
Again, since {C magnitude} measures {B magnitude} according to the units in {E magnitude}, and a unit also measures {E magnitude} according to the units in it, a unit thus measures {E magnitude} the same number of times that {C magnitude} (measures) {B magnitude}.
Thus, as {C magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so a unit (is) to {E magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
And it was also shown that as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to a unit.
Thus, via equality, as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so the number {D magnitude} (is) to the (number) {E magnitude} [Prop. 5.22].

Thus, the commensurable magnitudes {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} have to one another the ratio which the number {D magnitude} (has) to the number {E magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
