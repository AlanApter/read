To find two rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, such that the square on the greater is larger than the (the square on) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable in length with the greater.

Let the rational (straight-line) {AB line} be laid out, and the two square numbers, {CE magnitude} and {ED magnitude}, such that the sum of them, {CD magnitude}, is not square [Prop. 10.28 lem. II].
And let the semi-circle {AFB arc O} have been drawn on {AB line}.
And let it be contrived that as {DC magnitude} (is) to {CE magnitude}, so the (square) on {BA line} (is) to the (square) on {AF line} [Prop. 10.6 corr].
And let {FB line} have been joined.

So, similarly to the (proposition) before this, we can show that {BA line} and {AF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And since as {DC magnitude} is to {CE magnitude}, so the (square) on {BA line} (is) to the (square) on {AF line}, thus, via conversion, as {CD magnitude} (is) to {DE magnitude}, so the (square) on {AB line} (is) to the (square) on {BF line} [Props. 5.19 corr., 3.31, 1.47].
And {CD magnitude} does not have to {DE magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.

Thus, the (square) on {AB line} does not have to the (square) on {BF line} the ratio which (some) square number has to (some) square number either.
Thus, {AB line} is incommensurable in length with {BF line} [Prop. 10.9].
And the square on {AB line} is greater than the (square on) {AF line} by the (square) on {FB line} [Prop. 1.47], (which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({AB line}).

Thus, {AB line} and {AF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {AB line} is greater than (the square on) {AF line} by the (square) on {FB line}, (which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({AB line}).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
