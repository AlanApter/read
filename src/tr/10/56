If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a third binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called second bimedial.

For let the area {ABCD polygon} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB line} and by the third binomial (straight-line) {AD line}, which has been divided into its (component) terms at {E point}, of which {AE line} is the greater.
I say that the square-root of area {AC polygon} is the irrational (straight-line which is) called second bimedial.

For let the same construction be made as previously.
And since {AD line} is a third binomial (straight-line), {AE line} and {ED line} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {AE line} is greater than (the square on) {ED line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE line}), and neither of {AE line} and {ED line} [is] commensurable in length with {AB line} [Def. 10.7].
So, similarly to that which has been previously demonstrated, we can show that {MO line} is the square-root of area {AC polygon}, and {MN line} and {NO line} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Hence, {MO line} is bimedial.
So, we must show that (it is) also second (bimedial).

[And] since {DE line} is incommensurable in length with {AB line}---that is to say, with {EK line}---and {DE line} (is) commensurable (in length) with {EF line}, {EF line} is thus incommensurable in length with {EK line} [Prop. 10.13].
And they are (both) rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {FE line} and {EK line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{EL polygon}---that is to say, {MR polygon}---[is] thus medial [Prop. 10.21].
And it is contained by {MN line} and {NO line}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {MN line} and {NO line} is medial.

Thus, {MO line} is a second bimedial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.38].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
