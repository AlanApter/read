A (straight-line) commensurable in length with an apotome is an apotome, and (is) the same in order.

Let {AB magnitude} be an apotome, and let {CD magnitude} be commensurable in length with {AB magnitude}.
I say that {CD magnitude} is also an apotome, and (is) the same in order as {AB magnitude}.

For since {AB magnitude} is an apotome, let {BE magnitude} be an attachment to it.
Thus, {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And let it have been contrived that the (ratio) of {BE magnitude} to {DF magnitude} is the same as the ratio of {AB magnitude} to {CD magnitude} [Prop. 6.12].
Thus, also, as one is to one, (so) all [are] to all [Prop. 5.12].
And thus as the whole {AE magnitude} is to the whole {CF magnitude}, so {AB magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude}.
And {AB magnitude} (is) commensurable in length with {CD magnitude}.
{AE magnitude} (is) thus also commensurable (in length) with {CF magnitude}, and {BE magnitude} with {DF magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
And {AE magnitude} and {BE magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are also rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.13].
[{CD magnitude} is thus an apotome.
So, I say that (it is) also the same in order as {AB magnitude}.]

Therefore, since as {AE magnitude} is to {CF magnitude}, so {BE magnitude} (is) to {DF magnitude}, thus, alternately, as {AE magnitude} is to {EB magnitude}, so {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].
So, the square on {AE magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {EB magnitude} either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable, or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable, (in length) with ({AE magnitude}).
Therefore, if the (square) on {AE magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {EB magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE magnitude}) then the square on {CF magnitude} will also be greater than (the square on) {FD magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({CF magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].
And if {AE magnitude} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then so (is) {CF magnitude} [Prop. 10.12], and if {BE magnitude} (is commensurable), so (is) {DF magnitude}, and if neither of {AE magnitude} or {EB magnitude} (are commensurable), neither (are) either of {CF magnitude} or {FD magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].
And if the (square) on {AE magnitude} is greater [than (the square on) {EB magnitude}] by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({AE magnitude}) then the (square) on {CF magnitude} will also be greater than (the square on) {FD magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({CF magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].
And if {AE magnitude} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), so (is) {CF magnitude} [Prop. 10.12], and if {BE magnitude} (is commensurable), so (is) {DF magnitude}, and if neither of {AE magnitude} or {EB magnitude} (are commensurable), neither (are) either of {CF magnitude} or {FD magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].

Thus, {CD magnitude} is an apotome, and (is) the same in order as {AB magnitude} [Defs. 10.11-10.16].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
