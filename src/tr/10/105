A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with a minor (straight-line) is a minor (straight-line).

For let {AB magnitude} be a minor (straight-line), and (let) {CD magnitude} (be) commensurable (in length) with {AB magnitude}.
I say that {CD magnitude} is also a minor (straight-line).

For let the same things have been contrived (as in the former proposition).
And since {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square [Prop. 10.76], {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are thus also (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square [Prop. 10.13].
Therefore, since as {AE magnitude} is to {EB magnitude}, so {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Props. 5.12, 5.16], thus also as the (square) on {AE magnitude} is to the (square) on {EB magnitude}, so the (square) on {CF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FD magnitude} [Prop. 6.22].
Thus, via composition, as the (sum of the squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is to the (square) on {EB magnitude}, so the (sum of the squares) on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.18], [also alternately].
And the (square) on {BE magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {DF magnitude} [Prop. 10.104].
The sum of the squares on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (is) thus also commensurable with the sum of the squares on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.16, 10.11].
And the sum of the (squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is rational [Prop. 10.76].
Thus, the sum of the (squares) on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} is also rational [Def. 10.4].
Again, since as the (square) on {AE magnitude} is to the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude}, so the (square) on {CF magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and the square on {AE magnitude} (is) commensurable with the square on {CF magnitude}, the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is thus also commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}.
And the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (is) medial [Prop. 10.76].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
{CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are thus (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them rational, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial.

Thus, {CD magnitude} is a minor (straight-line) [Prop. 10.76].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
