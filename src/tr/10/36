If two rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only are added together then the whole (straight-line) is irrational---let it be called a binomial (straight-line).

For let the two rational (straight-lines), {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid down together.
I say that the whole (straight-line), {AC magnitude}, is irrational.
For since {AB magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {BC magnitude}---for they are commensurable in square only---and as {AB magnitude} (is) to {BC magnitude}, so the (rectangle contained) by {ABC magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {BC magnitude}, the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is thus incommensurable with the (square) on {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
But, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And (the sum of) the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {BC magnitude}---for the rational (straight-lines) {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.15].
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is incommensurable with (the sum of) the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].
And, via composition, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, plus (the sum of) the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}---that is to say, the (square) on {AC magnitude} [Prop. 2.4]---is incommensurable with the sum of the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.16].
And the sum of the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {AC magnitude} [is] irrational [Def. 10.4].
Hence, {AC magnitude} is also irrational [Def. 10.4]---let it be called a binomial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
