If a straight-line, which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them medial, and, moreover, the (sum of the) squares on them incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by them, is subtracted from a(nother) straight-line then the remainder is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called that which makes with a medial (area) a medial whole.

For let the straight-line {BC magnitude}, which is incommensurable in square {AB magnitude}, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the (straight-line) {AB magnitude} [Prop. 10.35].
I say that the remainder {AC magnitude} is the irrational (straight-line) called that which makes with a medial (area) a medial whole.

For let the rational (straight-line) {DI line} be laid down.
And let {DE polygon}, equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, have been applied to {DI line}, producing {DG line} as breadth.
And let {DH polygon}, equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, have been subtracted (from {DE polygon}) [producing {DF line} as breadth].
Thus, the remainder {FE polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AC magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].
Hence, {AC magnitude} is the square-root of {FE polygon}.
And since the sum of the squares on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is medial, and is equal to {DE polygon}, {DE polygon} [is] thus medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {DI line}, producing {DG line} as breadth.
Thus, {DG line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {DI line} [Prop. 10.22].
Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is medial, and is equal to {DH polygon}, {DH polygon} is thus medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {DI line}, producing {DF line} as breadth.
Thus, {DF line} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {DI line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, {DE polygon} (is) also incommensurable with {DH polygon}.
And as {DE polygon} (is) to {DH polygon}, so {DG line} also is to {DF line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {DG line} (is) incommensurable (in length) with {DF line} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational.
Thus, {GD line} and {DF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {FG line} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
And {FH line} (is) rational.
And the [rectangle] contained by a rational (straight-line) and an apotome is irrational [Prop. 10.20], and its square-root is irrational.
And {AC magnitude} is the square-root of {FE polygon}.
Thus, {AC magnitude} is irrational.
Let it be called that which makes with a medial (area) a medial whole.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
