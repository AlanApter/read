Only one medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a medial (area) with the whole, can be attached to a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

Let {AB magnitude} be a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), with {BC magnitude} (so) attached to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a medial (area)---(namely, that contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.75].
I say that a(nother) medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a medial (area) with the whole, cannot be attached to {AB magnitude}.

For, if possible, let {BD magnitude} be (so) attached.
Thus, {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are also medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a medial (area)---(namely, that contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} [Prop. 10.75].
And let the rational (straight-line) {EF line} be laid down.
And let {EG polygon}, equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, have been applied to {EF line}, producing {EM line} as breadth.
And let {HG polygon}, equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, have been subtracted (from {EG polygon}), producing {HM line} as breadth.
The remainder {EL polygon} is thus equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].
Hence, {AB magnitude} is the square-root of {EL polygon}.
So, again, let {EI polygon}, equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} have been applied to {EF line}, producing {EN line} as breadth.
And {EL polygon} is also equal to the square on {AB magnitude}.
Thus, the remainder {HI polygon} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].
And since {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are (both) medial (straight-lines), the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is also medial.
And it is equal to {EG polygon}.
Thus, {EG polygon} is also medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF line}, producing {EM line} as breadth.
Thus, {EM line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF line} [Prop. 10.22].
Again, since the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is medial, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
And it is equal to {HG polygon}.
Thus, {HG polygon} is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF line}, producing {HM line} as breadth.
Thus, {HM line} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are commensurable in square only, {AC magnitude} is thus incommensurable in length with {CB magnitude}.
And as {AC magnitude} (is) to {CB magnitude}, so the (square) on {AC magnitude} is to the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {AC magnitude} is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
But, the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {AC magnitude}, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].
And {EG polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}.
And {GH polygon} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}.
Thus, {EG polygon} is incommensurable with {HG polygon}.
And as {EG polygon} (is) to {HG polygon}, so {EM line} is to {HM line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EM line} is incommensurable in length with {MH line} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {EM line} and {MH line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EH line} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73], and {HM line} (is) attached to it.
So, similarly, we can show that {HN line} (is) also (commensurable in square only with {EN line} and is) attached to ({EH line}).
Thus, different straight-lines, which are commensurable in square only with the whole, are attached to an apotome.
The very thing is impossible [Prop. 10.79].

Thus, only one medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a medial (area) with the whole, can be attached to a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
