If a rational (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, is subtracted from a(nother) rational (straight-line) then the remainder is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called an apotome.

For let the rational (straight-line) {BC magnitude}, which commensurable in square only with the whole, have been subtracted from the rational (straight-line) {AB magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {AC magnitude} is that irrational (straight-line) called an apotome.

For since {AB magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {BC magnitude}, and as {AB magnitude} is to {BC magnitude}, so the (square) on {AB magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], the (square) on {AB magnitude} is thus incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
But, the (sum of the) squares on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {AB magnitude} [Prop. 10.15], and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And, inasmuch as the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} plus the (square) on {CA magnitude} [Prop. 2.7], the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is thus also incommensurable with the remaining (square) on {AC magnitude} [Props. 10.13, 10.16].
And the (sum of the squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is rational.
{AC magnitude} is thus an irrational (straight-line) [Def. 10.4].
And let it be called an apotome.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
