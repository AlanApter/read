If two straight-lines (which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial, and, moreover, incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them, are added together then the whole straight-line is irrational---let it be called the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

For let the two straight-lines, {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, incommensurable in square, (and) fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [Prop. 10.35].
I say that {AC magnitude} is irrational.

Let the rational (straight-line) {DE line} be laid out, and let (the rectangle) {DF polygon}, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, and (the rectangle) {GH polygon}, equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, have been applied to {DE line}.
Thus, the whole of {DH polygon} is equal to the square on {AC magnitude} [Prop. 2.4].
And since the sum of the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is medial, and is equal to {DF polygon}, {DF polygon} is thus also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {DE line}.
Thus, {DG line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {DE line} [Prop. 10.22].
So, for the same (reasons), {GK line} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {GF line}---that is to say, {DE line}.
And since (the sum of) the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, {DF polygon} is incommensurable with {GH polygon}.
Hence, {DG line} is also incommensurable (in length) with {GK line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And they are rational.
Thus, {DG line} and {GK line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {DK line} is irrational, and that (straight-line which is) called binomial [Prop. 10.36].
And {DE line} (is) rational.
Thus, {DH polygon} is irrational, and its square-root is irrational [Def. 10.4].
And {AC magnitude} (is) the square-root of {HD polygon}.
Thus, {AC magnitude} is irrational---let it be called the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
