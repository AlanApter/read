If two incommensurable magnitudes are added together then the whole will also be incommensurable with each of them.
And if the whole is incommensurable with one of them then the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable (with one another).

For let the two incommensurable magnitudes {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} be laid down together.
I say that that the whole {AC magnitude} is also incommensurable with each of {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}.

For if {CA magnitude} and {AB magnitude} are not incommensurable then some magnitude will measure [them].
If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be {D magnitude}.
Therefore, since {D magnitude} measures (both) {CA magnitude} and {AB magnitude}, it will thus also measure the remainder {BC magnitude}.
And it also measures {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} measures (both) {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}.
Thus, {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are commensurable [Def. 10.1].
But they were also assumed (to be) incommensurable.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) {CA magnitude} and {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {CA magnitude} and {AB magnitude} are incommensurable [Def. 10.1].
So, similarly, we can show that {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are also incommensurable.
Thus, {AC magnitude} is incommensurable with each of {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}.

And so let {AC magnitude} be incommensurable with one of {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}.
So let it, first of all, be incommensurable with {AB magnitude}.
I say that {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are also incommensurable.
For if they are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them.
Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be {D magnitude}.
Therefore, since {D magnitude} measures (both) {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, it will thus also measure the whole {AC magnitude}.
And it also measures {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} measures (both) {CA magnitude} and {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {CA magnitude} and {AB magnitude} are commensurable [Def. 10.1].
But they were also assumed (to be) incommensurable.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}.
Thus, {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are incommensurable [Def. 10.1].

Thus, if two...magnitudes, and so on ....
