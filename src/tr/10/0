1. Those magnitudes measured by the same measure are said (to be) commensurable, but (those) of which no (magnitude) admits to be a common measure (are said to be) incommensurable.

2. (Two) straight-lines are commensurable in squareâ€¡ when the squares on them are measured by the same area, but (are) incommensurable (in square) when no area admits to be a common measure of the squares on them.

3. These things being assumed, it is proved that there exist an infinite multitude of straight-lines commensurable and incommensurable with an assigned straight-line---those (incommensurable) in length only, and those also (commensurable or incommensurable) in square.
Therefore, let the assigned straight-line be called rational.
And (let) the (straight-lines) commensurable with it, either in length and square, or in square only, (also be called) rational.
But let the (straight-lines) incommensurable with it be called irrational.

4. And let the square on the assigned straight-line be called rational.
And (let areas) commensurable with it (also be called) rational.
But (let areas) incommensurable with it (be called) irrational, and (let) their square-roots (also be called) irrational---the sides themselves, if the (areas) are squares, and the (straight-lines) describing squares equal to them, if the (areas) are some other rectilinear (figure).
