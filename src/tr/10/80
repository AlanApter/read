Only one medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a rational (area) with the whole, can be attached to a first apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For let {AB magnitude} be a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), and let {BC magnitude} be (so) attached to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a rational (area)---(namely, that contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.74].
I say that a(nother) medial (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a rational (area) with the whole, cannot be attached to {AB magnitude}.

For, if possible, let {DB magnitude} also be (so) attached to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a rational (area)---(namely, that) contained by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} [Prop. 10.74].
And since by whatever (area) the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}, the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} also exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by this (same area).
For [again] both exceed by the same (area)---(namely), the (square) on {AB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].
Thus, alternately, by whatever (area) the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} also exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by this (same area).
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area).
For both (are) rational (areas).
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} also exceeds the (sum of the) [squares] on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area).
The very thing is impossible.
For both are medial (areas) [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.], and a medial (area) cannot exceed a(nother) medial (area) by a rational (area) [Prop. 10.26].

Thus, only one medial (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a rational (area) with the whole, can be attached to a first apotome of a medial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
