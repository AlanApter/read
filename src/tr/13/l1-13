It must be shown that as {AB line} is to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AD line} (is) to the (square) on {DC line}.

For, let the figure of the semi-circle have been set out, and let {DB line} have been joined.
And let the square {EC polygon} have been described on {AC line}.
And let the parallelogram {FB polygon} have been completed.
Therefore, since, on account of triangle {DAB polygon} being equiangular to triangle {DAC polygon} [Props. 6.8, 6.4], (proportionally) as {BA line} is to {AD line}, so {DA line} (is) to {AC line}, the (rectangle contained) by {BA line} and {AC line} is thus equal to the (square) on {AD line} [Prop. 6.17].
And since as {AB line} is to {BC line}, so {EB polygon} (is) to {BF polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
And {EB polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {BA line} and {AC line}â€”for {EA line} (is) equal to {AC line}.
And {BF polygon} the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line}.
Thus, as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (rectangle contained) by {BA line} and {AC line} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line}.
And the (rectangle contained) by {BA line} and {AC line} is equal to the (square) on {AD line}, and the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line} (is) equal to the (square) on {DC line}.
For the perpendicular {DC line} is the mean proportional to the pieces of the base, {AC line} and {CB line}, on account of {ADB angle} being a right-angle [Prop. 6.8 corr.].
Thus, as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AD line} (is) to the (square) on {DC line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
