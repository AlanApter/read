If a straight-line is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the sum of the squares on the whole and the lesser piece is three times the square on the greater piece.

Let {AB line} be a straight-line, and let it have been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {C point}, and let {AC line} be the greater piece.
I say that the (sum of the squares) on {AB line} and {BC line} is three times the (square) on {CA line}.

For let the square {ADEB polygon} have been described on {AB line}, and let the (remainder of the) figure have been drawn.
Therefore, since {AB line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {C point}, and {AC line} is the greater piece, the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line} is thus equal to the (square) on {AC line} [Def. 6.3, Prop. 6.17].
And {AK polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line}, and {HG polygon} the (square) on {AC line}.
Thus, {AK polygon} is equal to {HG polygon}.
And since {AF polygon} is equal to {FE polygon} [Prop. 1.43], let {CK polygon} have been added to both.
Thus, the whole of {AK polygon} is equal to the whole of {CE polygon}.
Thus, {AK polygon} plus {CE polygon} is double {AK polygon}.
But, {AK polygon} plus {CE polygon} is the gnomon {LMN given} plus the square {CK polygon}.
Thus, gnomon {LMN given} plus square {CK polygon} is double {AK polygon}.
But, indeed, {AK polygon} was also shown (to be) equal to {HG polygon}.
Thus, gnomon {LMN given} plus [square {CK polygon} is double {HG polygon}.
Hence, gnomon {LMN given} plus] the squares {CK polygon} and {HG polygon} is three times the square {HG polygon}.
And gnomon {LMN given} plus the squares {CK polygon} and {HG polygon} is the whole of {AE polygon} plus {CK polygon}—which are the squares on {AB line} and {BC line} (respectively)—and {GH polygon} (is) the square on {AC line}.
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on {AB line} and {BC line} is three times the square on {AC line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
