To find the least number which three given numbers (all) measure.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} be the three given numbers.
So it is required to find the least number which they (all) measure.

For let the least (number), {D magnitude}, measured by the two (numbers) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 7.34].
So {C magnitude} either measures, or does not measure, {D magnitude}.
Let it, first of all, measure ({D magnitude}).
And {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} also measure {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} (all) measure {D magnitude}.
So I say that ({D magnitude} is) also the least (number measured by {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}).
For if not, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} will (all) measure [some] number which is less than {D magnitude}.
Let them measure {E magnitude} (which is less than {D magnitude}).
Since {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} (all) measure {E magnitude} then {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} thus also measure {E magnitude}.
Thus, the least (number) measured by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} will also measure [{E magnitude}] [Prop. 7.35].
And {D magnitude} is the least (number) measured by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} will measure {E magnitude}, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} cannot (all) measure some number which is less than {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} (all) measure the least (number) {D magnitude}.

So, again, let {C magnitude} not measure {D magnitude}.
And let the least number, {E magnitude}, measured by {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 7.34].
Since {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} measure {D magnitude}, and {D magnitude} measures {E magnitude}, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} thus also measure {E magnitude}.
And {C magnitude} also measures [{E magnitude}].
Thus, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} [also] measure {E magnitude}.
So I say that ({E magnitude} is) also the least (number measured by {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}).
For if not, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} will (all) measure some (number) which is less than {E magnitude}.
Let them measure {F magnitude} (which is less than {E magnitude}).
Since {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} (all) measure {F magnitude}, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} thus also measure {F magnitude}.
Thus, the least (number) measured by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} will also measure {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.35].
And {D magnitude} is the least (number) measured by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} measures {F magnitude}.
And {C magnitude} also measures {F magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} and {C magnitude} (both) measure {F magnitude}.
Hence, the least (number) measured by {D magnitude} and {C magnitude} will also measure {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.35].
And {E magnitude} is the least (number) measured by {C magnitude} and {D magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} measures {F magnitude}, the greater (measuring) the lesser.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} cannot measure some number which is less than {E magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} (is) the least (number) which is measured by {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
