If a number is that part of a number that a (part) taken away (is) of a (part) taken away then the remainder will also be the same part of the remainder that the whole (is) of the whole.

For let a number {AB magnitude} be that part of a number {CD magnitude} that a (part) taken away {AE magnitude} (is) of a part taken away {CF magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {EB magnitude} is also the same part of the remainder {FD magnitude} that the whole {AB magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude}.

For which(ever) part {AE magnitude} is of {CF magnitude}, let {EB magnitude} also be the same part of {CG magnitude}.
And since which(ever) part {AE magnitude} is of {CF magnitude}, {EB magnitude} is also the same part of {CG magnitude}, thus which(ever) part {AE magnitude} is of {CF magnitude}, {AB magnitude} is also the same part of {GF magnitude} [Prop. 7.5].
And which(ever) part {AE magnitude} is of {CF magnitude}, {AB magnitude} is also assumed (to be) the same part of {CD magnitude}.
Thus, also, which(ever) part {AB magnitude} is of {GF magnitude}, ({AB magnitude}) is also the same part of {CD magnitude}.
Thus, {GF magnitude} is equal to {CD magnitude}.
Let {CF magnitude} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remainder {GC magnitude} is equal to the remainder {FD magnitude}.
And since which(ever) part {AE magnitude} is of {CF magnitude}, {EB magnitude} [is] also the same part of {GC magnitude}, and {GC magnitude} (is) equal to {FD magnitude}, thus which(ever) part {AE magnitude} is of {CF magnitude}, {EB magnitude} is also the same part of {FD magnitude}.
But, which(ever) part {AE magnitude} is of {CF magnitude}, {AB magnitude} is also the same part of {CD magnitude}.
Thus, the remainder {EB magnitude} is also the same part of the remainder {FD magnitude} that the whole {AB magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
