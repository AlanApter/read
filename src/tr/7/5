If a number is part of a number, and another (number) is the same part of another, then the sum (of the leading numbers) will also be the same part of the sum (of the following numbers) that one (number) is of another.

For let a number {A magnitude} be part of a [number] {BC magnitude}, and another (number) {D magnitude} (be) the same part of another (number){EF magnitude} that {A magnitude} (is) of {BC magnitude}.
I say that the sum {A magnitude}, {D magnitude} is also the same part of the sum {BC magnitude}, {EF magnitude} that {A magnitude} (is) of {BC magnitude}.

For since which(ever) part {A magnitude} is of {BC magnitude}, {D magnitude} is the same part of {EF magnitude}, thus as many numbers as are in {BC magnitude} equal to {A magnitude}, so many numbers are also in {EF magnitude} equal to {D magnitude}.
Let {BC magnitude} have been divided into {BG magnitude} and {GC magnitude}, equal to {A magnitude}, and {EF magnitude} into {EH magnitude} and {HF magnitude}, equal to {D magnitude}.
So the multitude of (divisions) {BG magnitude}, {GC magnitude} will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) {EH magnitude}, {HF magnitude}.
And since {BG magnitude} is equal to {A magnitude}, and {EH magnitude} to {D magnitude}, thus {BG magnitude}, {EH magnitude} (is) also equal to {A magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
So, for the same (reasons), {GC magnitude}, {HF magnitude} (is) also (equal) to {A magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
Thus, as many numbers as [are] in {BC magnitude} equal to {A magnitude}, so many are also in {BC magnitude}, {EF magnitude} equal to {A magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
Thus, as many times as {BC magnitude} is (divisible) by {A magnitude}, so many times is the sum {BC magnitude}, {EF magnitude} also (divisible) by the sum {A magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
Thus, which (ever) part {A magnitude} is of {BC magnitude}, the sum {A magnitude}, {D magnitude} is also the same part of the sum {BC magnitude}, {EF magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
