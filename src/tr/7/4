Any number is either part or parts of any (other) number, the lesser of the greater.

Let {A magnitude} and {BC magnitude} be two numbers, and let {BC magnitude} be the lesser.
I say that {BC magnitude} is either part or parts of {A magnitude}.

For {A magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are either prime to one another, or not.
Let {A magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, first of all, be prime to one another.
So separating {BC magnitude} into its constituent units, each of the units in {BC magnitude} will be some part of {A magnitude}.
Hence, {BC magnitude} is parts of {A magnitude}.

So let {A magnitude} and {BC magnitude} be not prime to one another.
So {BC magnitude} either measures, or does not measure, {A magnitude}.
Therefore, if {BC magnitude} measures {A magnitude} then {BC magnitude} is part of {A magnitude}.
And if not, let the greatest common measure, {D magnitude}, of {A magnitude} and {BC magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 7.2], and let {BC magnitude} have been divided into {BE magnitude}, {EF magnitude}, and {FC magnitude}, equal to {D magnitude}.
And since {D magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, {D magnitude} is a part of {A magnitude}.
And {D magnitude} is equal to each of {BE magnitude}, {EF magnitude}, and {FC magnitude}.
Thus, {BE magnitude}, {EF magnitude}, and {FC magnitude} are also each part of {A magnitude}.
Hence, {BC magnitude} is parts of {A magnitude}.

Thus, any number is either part or parts of any (other) number, the lesser of the greater.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
