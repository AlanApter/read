If two numbers multiplying some number make some (other numbers) then the (numbers) generated from them will have the same ratio as the multiplying (numbers).

For let the two numbers {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} make (the numbers) {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} (respectively, by) multiplying some number {C magnitude}.
I say that as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.

For since {A magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}, {C magnitude} has thus also made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {A magnitude} [Prop. 7.16].
So, for the same (reasons), {C magnitude} has also made {E magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}.
So the number {C magnitude} has made {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} (by) multiplying the two numbers {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
