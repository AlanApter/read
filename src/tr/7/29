Every prime number is prime to every number which it does not measure.

Let {A magnitude} be a prime number, and let it not measure {B magnitude}.
I say that {B magnitude} and {A magnitude} are prime to one another.
For if {B magnitude} and {A magnitude} are not prime to one another then some number will measure them.
Let {C magnitude} measure (them).
Since {C magnitude} measures {B magnitude}, and {A magnitude} does not measure {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is thus not the same as {A magnitude}.
And since {C magnitude} measures {B magnitude} and {A magnitude}, it thus also measures {A magnitude}, which is prime, (despite) not being the same as it.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some number cannot measure (both) {B magnitude} and {A magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
