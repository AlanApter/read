If four numbers are proportional then they will also be proportional alternately.

Let the four numbers {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, and {D magnitude} be proportional, (such that) as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
I say that they will also be proportional alternately, (such that) as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.

For since as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, thus which(ever) part, or parts, {A magnitude} is of {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is also the same part, or the same parts, of {D magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
Thus, alterately, which (ever) part, or parts, {A magnitude} is of {C magnitude}, {B magnitude} is also the same part, or the same parts, of {D magnitude} [Props. 7.9, 7.10].
Thus, as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
