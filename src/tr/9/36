If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is set out continuously in a double proportion, (starting) from a unit, until the whole sum added together becomes prime, and the sum multiplied into the last (number) makes some (number), then the (number so) created will be perfect.

For let any multitude of numbers, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, be set out (continuouly) in a double proportion, until the whole sum added together is made prime.
And let {E magnitude} be equal to the sum.
And let {E magnitude} make {FG magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
I say that {FG magnitude} is a perfect (number).

For as many as is the multitude of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, let so many (numbers), {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, have been taken in a double proportion, (starting) from {E magnitude}.
Thus, via equality, as {A magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude} [Prop. 7.14].
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {E magnitude}, {D magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude}, {M magnitude}.
And {FG magnitude} is the (number created) from (multiplying) {E magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
Thus, {FG magnitude} is also the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude}, {M magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
Thus, {A magnitude} has made {FG magnitude} (by) multiplying {M magnitude}.
Thus, {M magnitude} measures {FG magnitude} according to the units in {A magnitude}.
And {A magnitude} is a dyad.
Thus, {FG magnitude} is double {M magnitude}.
And {M magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {E magnitude} are also continuously double one another.
Thus, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, {FG magnitude} are continuously proportional in a double proportion.
So let {HN magnitude} and {FO magnitude}, each equal to the first (number) {E magnitude}, have been subtracted from the second (number) {HK magnitude} and the last {FG magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, as the excess of the second number is to the first, so the excess of the last (is) to (the sum of) all those (numbers) before it [Prop. 9.35].
Thus, as {NK magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {OG magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {KH magnitude}, {E magnitude}.
And {NK magnitude} is equal to {E magnitude}.
And thus {OG magnitude} is equal to {M magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {E magnitude}.
And {FO magnitude} is also equal to {E magnitude}, and {E magnitude} to {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, and a unit.
Thus, the whole of {FG magnitude} is equal to {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, and a unit.
And it is measured by them.
I also say that {FG magnitude} will be measured by no other (numbers) except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and a unit.
For, if possible, let some (number) {P magnitude} measure {FG magnitude}, and let {P magnitude} not be the same as any of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}.
And as many times as {P magnitude} measures {FG magnitude}, so many units let there be in {Q magnitude}.
Thus, {Q magnitude} has made {FG magnitude} (by) multiplying {P magnitude}.
But, in fact, {E magnitude} has also made {FG magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
Thus, as {E magnitude} is to {Q magnitude}, so {P magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
And since {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} are continually proportional, (starting) from a unit, {D magnitude} will thus not be measured by any other numbers except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} [Prop. 9.13].
And {P magnitude} was assumed not (to be) the same as any of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
Thus, {P magnitude} does not measure {D magnitude}.
But, as {P magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {Q magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} does not measure {Q magnitude} either [Def. 7.20].
And {E magnitude} is a prime (number).
And every prime number [is] prime to every (number) which it does not measure [Prop. 7.29].
Thus, {E magnitude} and {Q magnitude} are prime to one another.
And (numbers) prime (to one another are) also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as them) [Prop. 7.21], and the least (numbers) measure those (numbers) having the same ratio as them an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [Prop. 7.20].
And as {E magnitude} is to {Q magnitude}, (so) {P magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} measures {P magnitude} the same number of times as {Q magnitude} (measures) {D magnitude}.
And {D magnitude} is not measured by any other (numbers) except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
Thus, {Q magnitude} is the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
Let it be the same as {B magnitude}.
And as many as is the multitude of {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, let so many (of the set out numbers) have been taken, (starting) from {E magnitude}, (namely) {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}.
And {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude} are in the same ratio as {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}.
Thus, via equality, as {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, (so) {E magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude} [Prop. 7.14].
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {B magnitude}, {L magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from multiplying {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
But, the (number created) from (multiplying) {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {Q magnitude}, {P magnitude}.
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {Q magnitude}, {P magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {B magnitude}, {L magnitude}.
Thus, as {Q magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, (so) {L magnitude} (is) to {P magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
And {Q magnitude} is the same as {B magnitude}.
Thus, {L magnitude} is also the same as {P magnitude}.
The very thing (is) impossible.
For {P magnitude} was assumed not (to be) the same as any of the (numbers) set out.
Thus, {FG magnitude} cannot be measured by any number except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and a unit.
And {FG magnitude} was shown (to be) equal to (the sumof) {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and a unit.
Anda perfect number is one which is equal to (the sum of) its own parts [Def. 7.22].
Thus, {FG magnitude} is a perfect (number).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
