Each of the numbers (which is continually) doubled, (starting) from a dyad, is an even-times-even (number) only.

For let any multitude of numbers whatsoever, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, have been (continually) doubled, (starting) from the dyad {A magnitude}.
I say that {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} are even-times-even (numbers) only.

In fact, (it is) clear that each [of {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}] is an even-times-even (number).
For it is doubled from a dyad [Def. 7.8].
I also say that (they are even-times-even numbers) only.
For let a unit be laid down.
Therefore, since any multitude of numbers whatsoever are continuously proportional, starting from a unit, and the (number) {A magnitude} after the unit is prime, the greatest of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, (namely) {D magnitude}, will not be measured by any other (numbers) except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} [Prop. 9.13].
And each of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is even.
Thus, {D magnitude} is an even-time-even (number) only [Def. 7.8].
So, similarly, we can show that each of {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is [also] an even-time-even (number) only.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
