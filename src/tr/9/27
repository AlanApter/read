If an even (number) is subtracted from an odd number then the remainder will be odd.

For let the even (number) {BC magnitude} have been subtracted from the odd (number) {AB magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {CA magnitude} is odd.

[For] let the unit {AD magnitude} have been subtracted (from {AB magnitude}).
{DB magnitude} is thus even [Def. 7.7].
And {BC magnitude} is also even.
Thus, the remainder {CD magnitude} is also even [Prop. 9.24].
{CA magnitude} (is) thus odd [Def. 7.7].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
