If two numbers are prime to one another then as the first is to the second, so the second (will) not (be) to some other (number).

For let the two numbers {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be prime to one another.
I say that as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {B magnitude} is not to some other (number).

For, if possible, let it be that as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, (so) {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}.
And {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (are) prime (to one another).
And (numbers) prime (to one another are) also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as them) [Prop. 7.21].
And the least numbers measure those (numbers) having the same ratio (as them) an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [Prop. 7.20].
Thus, {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude}, as the leading (measuring) the leading.
And ({A magnitude}) also measures itself.
Thus, {A magnitude} measures {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, which are prime to one another.
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {B magnitude} cannot be to {C magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
