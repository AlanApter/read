There exist two numbers in mean proportion to two (given) cube numbers.
And (one) cube (number) has to the (other) cube (number) a cubed ratio with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter).

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be cube numbers, and let {C magnitude} be the side of {A magnitude}, and {D magnitude} (the side) of {B magnitude}.
I say that there exist two numbers in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, and that {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {D magnitude}.

For let {C magnitude} make {E magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, and let it make {F magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
And let {D magnitude} make {G magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, and let {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} make {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, respectively, (by) multiplying {F magnitude}.

And since {A magnitude} is cube, and {C magnitude} (is) its side, and {C magnitude} has made {E magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, {C magnitude} has thus made {E magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, and has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}.
And so, for the same (reasons), {D magnitude} has made {G magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, and has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {G magnitude}.
And since {C magnitude} has made {E magnitude}, {F magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, respectively, thus as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And so, for the same (reasons), as {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 7.18].
Again, since {C magnitude} has made {A magnitude}, {H magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, respectively, thus as {E magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And as {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
And thus as {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}.
Again, since {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} have made {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, respectively, (by) multiplying {F magnitude}, thus as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude} [Prop. 7.18].
Again, since {D magnitude} has made {K magnitude}, {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, respectively, thus as {F magnitude} is to {G magnitude}, so {K magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And as {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
And thus as {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}, and {H magnitude} to {K magnitude}, and {K magnitude} to {B magnitude}.
Thus, {H magnitude} and {K magnitude} are two (numbers) in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.

So I say that {A magnitude} also has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {D magnitude}.
For since {A magnitude}, {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {B magnitude} are four (continuously) proportional numbers, {A magnitude} thus has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) {A magnitude} (has) to {H magnitude} [Def. 5.10].
And as {A magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
And [thus] {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a cubed ratio with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {D magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
