If a cube number does not measure a(nother) cube number then the side (of the former) will not measure the side (of the latter) either.
And if the side (of a cube number) does not measure the side (of another cube number) then the (former) cube (number) will not measure the (latter) cube (number) either.

For let the cube number {A magnitude} not measure the cube number {B magnitude}.
And let {C magnitude} be the side of {A magnitude}, and {D magnitude} (the side) of {B magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} will not measure {D magnitude}.

For if {C magnitude} measures {D magnitude} then {A magnitude} will also measure {B magnitude} [Prop. 8.15].
And {A magnitude} does not measure {B magnitude}.
Thus, {C magnitude} does not measure {D magnitude} either.

And so let {C magnitude} not measure {D magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} will not measure {B magnitude} either.
For if {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude} then {C magnitude} will also measure {D magnitude} [Prop. 8.15].
And {C magnitude} does not measure {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} will not measure {B magnitude} either.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
