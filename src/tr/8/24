If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number (has) to a(nother) square number, and the first is square, then the second will also be square.

For let two numbers, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, have to one another the ratio which the square number {C magnitude} (has) to the square number {D magnitude}.
And let {A magnitude} be square.
I say that {B magnitude} is also square.

For since {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} are square, {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} are thus similar plane (numbers).
Thus, one number falls (between) {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.18].
And as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, (so) {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
Thus, one number also falls (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.8].
And {A magnitude} is square.
Thus, {B magnitude} is also square [Prop. 8.22].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
