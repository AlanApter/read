If there are any multitude whatsoever of [continuously] proportional numbers, and the first measures the last, then (the first) will also measure the second.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} be any number whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers.
And let {A magnitude} measure {D magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} also measures {B magnitude}.

For if {A magnitude} does not measure {B magnitude} then no other (number) will measure any other (number) either [Prop. 8.6].
But {A magnitude} measures {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} also measures {B magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
