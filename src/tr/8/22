If three numbers are continuously proportional, and the first is square, then the third will also be square.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} be three continuously proportional numbers, and let the first {A magnitude} be square.
I say that the third {C magnitude} is also square.

For since one number, {B magnitude}, is in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {C magnitude}, {A magnitude} and {C magnitude} are thus similar plane (numbers) [Prop. 8.20].
And {A magnitude} is square.
Thus, {C magnitude} is also square [Def. 7.21].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
