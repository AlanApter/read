To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double the remaining (angle).

Let some straight-line {AB line} be taken, and let it have been cut at point {C point} so that the rectangle contained by {AB line} and {BC line} is equal to the square on {CA line} [Prop. 2.11].
And let the circle {BDE circle A} have been drawn with center {A point}, and radius {AB line}.
And let the straight-line {BD line}, equal to the straight-line {AC line}, being not greater than the diameter of circle {BDE circle A}, have been inserted into circle {BDE circle A} [Prop. 4.1].
And let {AD line} and {DC line} have been joined.
And let the circle {ACD circle O} have been circumscribed about triangle {ACD polygon} [Prop. 4.5].

And since the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line} is equal to the (square) on {AC line}, and {AC line} (is) equal to {BD line}, the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line} is thus equal to the (square) on {BD line}.
And since some point {B point} has been taken outside of circle {ACD circle O}, and two straight-lines {BA line} and {BD line} have radiated from {B point} towards the circle {ACD circle O}, and (one) of them cuts (the circle), and (the other) meets (the circle), and the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line} is equal to the (square) on {BD line}, {BD line} thus touches circle {ACD circle O} [Prop. 3.37].
Therefore, since {BD line} touches (the circle), and {DC line} has been drawn across (the circle) from the point of contact {D point}, the angle {BDC angle} is thus equal to the angle {DAC angle} in the alternate segment of the circle [Prop. 3.32].
Therefore, since {BDC angle} is equal to {DAC angle}, let {CDA angle} have been added to both.
Thus, the whole of {BDA angle} is equal to the two (angles) {CDA angle} and {DAC angle}.
But, the external (angle) {BCD angle} is equal to {CDA angle} and {DAC angle} [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, {BDA angle} is also equal to {BCD angle}.
But, {BDA angle} is equal to {CBD angle}, since the side {AD line} is also equal to {AB line} [Prop. 1.5].
So that {DBA angle} is also equal to {BCD angle}.
Thus, the three (angles) {BDA angle}, {DBA angle}, and {BCD angle} are equal to one another.
And since angle {DBC angle} is equal to {BCD angle}, side {BD line} is also equal to side {DC line} [Prop. 1.6].
But, {BD line} was assumed (to be) equal to {CA line}.
Thus, {CA line} is also equal to {CD line}.
So that angle {CDA angle} is also equal to angle {DAC angle} [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, {CDA angle} and {DAC angle} is double {DAC angle}.
But {BCD angle} (is) equal to {CDA angle} and {DAC angle}.
Thus, {BCD angle} is also double {CAD angle}.
And {BCD angle} (is) equal to to each of {BDA angle} and {DBA angle}.
Thus, {BDA angle} and {DBA angle} are each double {DAB angle}.

Thus, the isosceles triangle {ABD polygon} has been constructed having each of the angles at the base {BD line} double the remaining (angle).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
