The bases of equal pyramids which also have triangular bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
And those pyramids which have triangular bases whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal.

For let there be (two) equal pyramids having the triangular bases {ABC} and {DEF}, and apexes the points {G} and {H} (respectively).
I say that the bases of the pyramids {ABCG} and {DEFH} are reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (so) that as base {ABC} is to base {DEF}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG}.

For let the parallelepiped solids {BGML} and {EHQP} have been completed.
And since pyramid {ABCG} is equal to pyramid {DEFH}, and solid {BGML} is six times pyramid {ABCG} (see previous proposition), and solid {EHQP} (is) six times pyramid {DEFH}, solid {BGML} is thus equal to solid {EHQP}.
And the bases of equal parallelepiped solids are reciprocally proportional to their heights [Prop. 11.34].
Thus, as base {BM} is to base {EQ}, so the height of solid {EHQP} (is) to the height of solid {BGML}.
But, as base {BM} (is) to base {EQ}, so triangle {ABC} (is) to triangle {DEF} [Prop. 1.34].
And, thus, as triangle {ABC} (is) to triangle {DEF}, so the height of solid {EHQP} (is) to the height of solid {BGML} [Prop. 5.11].
But, the height of solid {EHQP} is the same as the height of pyramid {DEFH}, and the height of solid {BGML} is the same as the height of pyramid {ABCG}.
Thus, as base {ABC} is to base {DEF}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG}.
Thus, the bases of pyramids {ABCG} and {DEFH} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.

And so, let the bases of pyramids {ABCG} and {DEFH} be reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (thus) let base {ABC} be to base {DEF}, as the height of pyramid {DEFH} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG}.
I say that pyramid {ABCG} is equal to pyramid {DEFH}.

For, with the same construction, since as base {ABC} is to base {DEF}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH} (is) to the height of pyramid {ABCG}, but as base {ABC} (is) to base {DEF}, so parallelogram {BM} (is) to parallelogram {EQ} [Prop. 1.34], thus as parallelogram {BM} (is) to parallelogram {EQ}, so the height of pyramid {DEFH} (is) also to the height of pyramid {ABCG} [Prop. 5.11].
But, the height of pyramid {DEFH} is the same as the height of parallelepiped {EHQP}, and the height of pyramid {ABCG} is the same as the height of parallelepiped {BGML}.
Thus, as base {BM} is to base {EQ}, so the height of parallelepiped {EHQP} (is) to the height of parallelepiped {BGML}.
And those parallelepiped solids whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal [Prop. 11.34].
Thus, the parallelepiped solid {BGML} is equal to the parallelepiped solid {EHQP}.
And pyramid {ABCG} is a sixth part of {BGML}, and pyramid {DEFH} a sixth part of parallelepiped {EHQP}.
Thus, pyramid {ABCG} is equal to pyramid {DEFH}.

Thus, the bases of equal pyramids which also have triangular bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
And those pyramids having triangular bases whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
