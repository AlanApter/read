Any prism having a triangular base is divided into three pyramids having triangular bases (which are) equal to one another.

Let there be a prism whose base (is) triangle {ABC polygon}, and opposite (plane) {DEF polygon}.
I say that prism {ABCDEF given} is divided into three pyramids having triangular bases (which are) equal to one another.

For let {BD line}, {EC line}, and {CD line} have been joined.
Since {ABED polygon} is a parallelogram, and {BD line} is its diagonal, triangle {ABD polygon} is thus equal to triangle {EBD polygon} [Prop. 1.34].
And, thus, the pyramid whose base (is) triangle {ABD polygon}, and apex the point {C point}, is equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle {DEB polygon}, and apex the point {C point} [Prop. 12.5].
But, the pyramid whose base is triangle {DEB polygon}, and apex the point {C point}, is the same as the pyramid whose base is triangle {EBC polygon}, and apex the point {D point}.
For they are contained by the same planes.
And, thus, the pyramid whose base is {ABD polygon}, and apex the point {C point}, is equal to the pyramid whose base is {EBC polygon} and apex the point {D point}.
Again, since {FCBE polygon} is a parallelogram, and {CE line} is its diagonal, triangle {CEF polygon} is equal to triangle {CBE polygon} [Prop. 1.34].
And, thus, the pyramid whose base is triangle {BCE polygon}, and apex the point {D point}, is equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle {ECF polygon}, and apex the point {D point} [Prop. 12.5].
And the pyramid whose base is triangle {BCE polygon}, and apex the point {D point}, was shown (to be) equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle {ABD polygon}, and apex the point {C point}.
Thus, the pyramid whose base is triangle {CEF polygon}, and apex the point {D point}, is also equal to the pyramid whose base [is] triangle {ABD polygon}, and apex the point {C point}.
Thus, the prism {ABCDEF given} has been divided into three pyramids having triangular bases (which are) equal to one another.

And since the pyramid whose base is triangle {ABD polygon}, and apex the point {C point}, is the same as the pyramid whose base is triangle {CAB polygon}, and apex the point {D point}.
For they are contained by the same planes.
And the pyramid whose base (is) triangle {ABD polygon}, and apex the point {C point}, was shown (to be) a third of the prism whose base is triangle {ABC polygon}, and opposite (plane) {DEF polygon}, thus the pyramid whose base is triangle {ABC polygon}, and apex the point {D point}, is also a third of the pyramid having the same base, triangle {ABC polygon}, and opposite (plane) {DEF polygon}.

Corollary

And, from this, (it is) clear that any pyramid is the third part of the prism having the same base as it, and an equal height.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
