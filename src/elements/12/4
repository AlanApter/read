If there are two pyramids with the same height, having trianglular bases, and each of them is divided into two pyramids equal to one another, and similar to the whole, and into two equal prisms then as the base of one pyramid (is) to the base of the other pyramid, so (the sum of) all the prisms in one pyramid will be to (the sum of all) the equal number of prisms in the other pyramid.
Let there be two pyramids with the same height, having the triangular bases {ABC} and {DEF}, (with) apexes the points {G} and {H} (respectively).
And let each of them have been divided into two pyramids equal to one another, and similar to the whole, and into two equal prisms [Prop. 12.3].
I say that as base {ABC} is to base {DEF}, so (the sum of) all the prisms in pyramid {ABCG} (is) to (the sum of) all the equal number of prisms in pyramid {DEFH}.

For since {BO} is equal to {OC}, and {AL} to {LC}, {LO} is thus parallel to {AB}, and triangle {ABC} similar to triangle {LOC} [Prop. 12.3].
So, for the same (reasons), triangle {DEF} is also similar to triangle {RVF}.
And since {BC} is double {CO}, and {EF} (double) {FV}, thus as {BC} (is) to {CO}, so {EF} (is) to {FV}.
And the similar, and similarly laid out, rectilinear (figures) {ABC} and {LOC} have been described on {BC} and {CO} (respectively), and the similar, and similarly laid out, [rectilinear] (figures) {DEF} and {RVF} on {EF} and {FV} (respectively).
Thus, as triangle {ABC} is to triangle {LOC}, so triangle {DEF} (is) to triangle {RVF} [Prop. 6.22].
Thus, alternately, as triangle {ABC} is to [triangle] {DEF}, so [triangle] {LOC} (is) to triangle {RVF} [Prop. 5.16].
But, as triangle {LOC} (is) to triangle {RVF}, so the prism whose base [is] triangle {LOC}, and opposite (plane) {PMN}, (is) to the prism whose base (is) triangle RVF, and opposite (plane) {STU} (see lemma).
And, thus, as triangle {ABC} (is) to triangle {DEF}, so the prism whose base (is) triangle {LOC}, and opposite (plane) {PMN}, (is) to the prism whose base (is) triangle {RVF}, and opposite (plane) {STU}.
And as the aforementioned prisms (are) to one another, so the prism whose base (is) parallelogram {KBOL}, and opposite (side) straight-line {PM}, (is) to the prism whose base (is) parallelogram {QEVR}, and opposite (side) straight-line {ST} [Props. 11.39, 12.3].
Thus, also, (is) the (sum of the) two prisms—that whose base (is) parallelogram {KBOL}, and opposite (side) {PM}, and that whose base (is) {LOC}, and opposite (plane) {PMN}—to (the sum of) the (two) prisms—that whose base (is) {QEVR}, and opposite (side) straight-line {ST}, and that whose base (is) triangle {RVF}, and opposite (plane) {STU} [Prop. 5.12].
And, thus, as base {ABC} (is) to base {DEF}, so the (sum of the first) aforementioned two prisms (is) to the (sum of the second) aforementioned two prisms.

And, similarly, if pyramids {PMNG} and {STUH} are divided into two prisms, and two pyramids, as base {PMN} (is) to base {STU}, so (the sum of) the two prisms in pyramid {PMNG} will be to (the sum of) the two prisms in pyramid {STUH}.
But, as base {PMN} (is) to base {STU}, so base {ABC} (is) to base {DEF}.
For the triangles {PMN} and {STU} (are) equal to {LOC} and {RVF}, respectively.
And, thus, as base {ABC} (is) to base {DEF}, so (the sum of) the four prisms (is) to (the sum of) the four prisms [Prop. 5.12].
So, similarly, even if we divide the pyramids left behind into two pyramids and into two prisms, as base {ABC} (is) to base {DEF}, so (the sum of) all the prisms in pyramid {ABCG} will be to (the sum of) all the equal number of prisms in pyramid {DEFH}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Lemma

And one may show, as follows, that as triangle {LOC} is to triangle {RVF}, so the prism whose base (is) triangle {LOC}, and opposite (plane) {PMN}, (is) to the prism whose base (is) [triangle] {RVF}, and opposite (plane) {STU}.

For, in the same figure, let perpendiculars have been conceived (drawn) from (points) {G} and {H} to the planes {ABC} and {DEF} (respectively).
These clearly turn out to be equal, on account of the pyramids being assumed (to be) of equal height.
And since two straight-lines, {GC} and the perpendicular from {G}, are cut by the parallel planes {ABC} and {PMN} they will be cut in the same ratios [Prop. 11.17].
And {GC} was cut in half by the plane {PMN} at {N}.
Thus, the perpendicular from {G} to the plane {ABC} will also be cut in half by the plane {PMN}.
So, for the same (reasons), the perpendicular from {H} to the plane {DEF} will also be cut in half by the plane {STU}.
And the perpendiculars from {G} and {H} to the planes {ABC} and {DEF} (respectively) are equal.
Thus, the perpendiculars from the triangles {PMN} and {STU} to {ABC} and {DEF} (respectively, are) also equal.
Thus, the prisms whose bases are triangles {LOC} and {RVF}, and opposite (sides) {PMN} and {STU} (respectively), [are] of equal height.
And, hence, the parallelepiped solids described on the aforementioned prisms [are] of equal height and (are) to one another as their bases [Prop. 11.32].
Likewise, the halves (of the solids) [Prop. 11.28].
Thus, as base {LOC} is to base {RVF}, so the aforementioned prisms (are) to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
