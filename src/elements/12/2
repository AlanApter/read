Circles are to one another as the squares on (their) diameters.

Let {ABCD} and {EFGH} be circles, and [let] {BD} and {FH} [be] their diameters.
I say that as circle {ABCD} is to circle {EFGH}, so the square on {BD} (is) to the square on {FH}.

For if the circle {ABCD} is not to the (circle) {EFGH}, as the square on {BD} (is) to the (square) on {FH}, then as the (square) on {BD} (is) to the (square) on {FH}, so circle {ABCD} will be to some area either less than, or greater than, circle {EFGH}.
Let it, first of all, be (in that ratio) to (some) lesser (area), {S}.
And let the square {EFGH} have been inscribed in circle {EFGH} [Prop. 4.6].
So the inscribed square is greater than half of circle {EFGH}, inasmuch as if we draw tangents to the circle through the points {E}, {F}, {G}, and {H}, then square {EFGH} is half of the square circumscribed about the circle [Prop. 1.47], and the circle is less than the circumscribed square.
Hence, the inscribed square {EFGH} is greater than half of circle {EFGH}.
Let the circumferences {EF}, {FG}, {GH}, and {HE} have been cut in half at points {K}, {L}, {M}, and {N} (respectively), and let {EK}, {KF}, {FL}, {LG}, {GM}, {MH}, {HN}, and {NE} have been joined.
And, thus, each of the triangles {EKF}, {FLG}, {GMH}, and {HNE} is greater than half of the segment of the circle about it, inasmuch as if we draw tangents to the circle through points {K}, {L}, {M}, and {N}, and complete the parallelograms on the straight-lines {EF}, {FG}, {GH}, and {HE}, then each of the triangles {EKF}, {FLG}, {GMH}, and {HNE} will be half of the parallelogram about it, but the segment about it is less than the parallelogram.
Hence, each of the triangles {EKF}, {FLG}, {GMH}, and {HNE} is greater than half of the segment of the circle about it.
So, by cutting the circumferences remaining behind in half, and joining straight-lines, and doing this continually, we will (eventually) leave behind some segments of the circle whose (sum) will be less than the excess by which circle {EFGH} exceeds the area {S}.
For we showed in the first theorem of the tenth book that if two unequal magnitudes are laid out, and if (a part) greater than a half is subtracted from the greater, and (if from) the remainder (a part) greater than a half (is subtracted), and this happens continually, then some magnitude will (eventually) be left which will be less than the lesser laid out magnitude [Prop. 10.1].
Therefore, let the (segments) have been left, and let the (sum of the) segments of the circle {EFGH} on {EK}, {KF}, {FL}, {LG}, {GM}, {MH}, {HN}, and {NE} be less than the excess by which circle {EFGH} exceeds area {S}.
Thus, the remaining polygon {EKFLGMHN} is greater than area {S}.
And let the polygon {AOBPCQDR}, similar to the polygon {EKFLGMHN}, have been inscribed in circle {ABCD}.
Thus, as the square on {BD} is to the square on {FH}, so polygon {AOBPCQDR} (is) to polygon {EKFLGMHN} [Prop. 12.1].
But, also, as the square on {BD} (is) to the square on {FH}, so circle {ABCD} (is) to area {S}.
And, thus, as circle {ABCD} (is) to area {S}, so polygon {AOBPGQDR} (is) to polygon {EKFLGMHN} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, alternately, as circle {ABCD} (is) to the polygon (inscribed) within it, so area {S} (is) to polygon {EKFLGMHN} [Prop. 5.16].
And circle {ABCD} (is) greater than the polygon (inscribed) within it.
Thus, area {S} is also greater than polygon {EKFLGMHN}.
But, (it is) also less.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, the square on {BD} is not to the (square) on {FH}, as circle {ABCD} (is) to some area less than circle {EFGH}.
So,similarly,wecan show that the (square) on {FH} (is) not to the (square) on {BD} as circle {EFGH} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD} either.

So, I say that neither (is) the (square) on {BD} to the (square) on {FH}, as circle {ABCD} (is) to some area greater than circle {EFGH}.

For, if possible, let it be (in that ratio) to (some) greater (area), {S}.
Thus, inversely, as the square on {FH} [is] to the (square) on {DB}, so area {S} (is) to circle {ABCD} [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
But, as area {S} (is) to circle {ABCD}, so circle {EFGH} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD} (see lemma).
And, thus, as the (square) on {FH} (is) to the (square) on {BD}, so circle {EFGH} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD} [Prop. 5.11].
The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
Thus, as the square on {BD} is to the (square) on {FH}, so circle {ABCD} (is) not to some area greater than circle {EFGH}.
And it was shown that neither (is it in that ratio) to (some) lesser (area).
Thus, as the square on {BD} is to the (square) on {FH}, so circle {ABCD} (is) to circle {EFGH}.

Thus, circles are to one another as the squares on (their) diameters.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Lemma

So, I say that, area {S} being greater than circle {EFGH}, as area {S} is to circle {ABCD}, so circle {EFGH} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD}.

For let it have been contrived that as area {S} (is) to circle {ABCD}, so circle {EFGH} (is) to area {T}.
I say that area {T} is less than circle {ABCD}.
For since as area {S} is to circle {ABCD}, so circle {EFGH} (is) to area {T}, alternately, as area {S} is to circle {EFGH}, so circle {ABCD} (is) to area {T} [Prop. 5.16].
And area {S} (is) greater than circle {EFGH}.
Thus, circle {ABCD} (is) also greater than area {T} [Prop. 5.14].
Hence, as area {S} is to circle {ABCD}, so circle {EFGH} (is) to some area less than circle {ABCD}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
