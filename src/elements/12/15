The bases of equal cones and cylinders are reciprocally proportional to their heights.
And, those cones and cylinders whose bases (are) reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal.

Let there be equal cones and cylinders whose bases are the circles {ABCD} and {EFGH}, and the diameters of (the bases) {AC} and {EG}, and (whose) axes (are) {KL} and {MN}, which are also the heights of the cones and cylinders (respectively).
And let the cylinders {AO} and {EP} have been completed.
I say that the bases of cylinders {AO} and {EP} are reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (so) as base {ABCD} is to base {EFGH}, so height {MN} (is) to height {KL}.

For height {LK} is either equal to height {MN}, or not.
Let it, first of all, be equal.
And cylinder {AO} is also equal to cylinder {EP}.
And cones and cylinders having the same height are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.11].
Thus, base {ABCD} (is) also equal to base {EFGH}.
And, hence, reciprocally, as base {ABCD} (is) to base {EFGH}, so height {MN} (is) to height {KL}.
And so, let height {LK} not be equal to {MN}, but let {MN} be greater.
And let {QN}, equal to {KL}, have been cut off from height {MN}.
And let the cylinder {EP} have been cut, through point {Q}, by the plane {TUS} (which is) parallel to the planes of the circles {EFGH} and {RP}.
And let cylinder {ES} have been conceived, with base the circle {EFGH}, and height {NQ}.
And since cylinder {AO} is equal to cylinder {EP}, thus, as cylinder {AO} (is) to cylinder {ES}, so cylinder {EP} (is) to cylinder {ES} [Prop. 5.7].
But, as cylinder {AO} (is) to cylinder {ES}, so base {ABCD} (is) to base {EFGH}.
For cylinders {AO} and {ES} (have) the same height [Prop. 12.11].
And as cylinder {EP} (is) to (cylinder) {ES}, so height {MN} (is) to height {QN}.
For cylinder {EP} has been cut by a plane which is parallel to its opposite planes [Prop. 12.13].
And, thus, as base {ABCD} is to base {EFGH}, so height {MN} (is) to height {QN} [Prop. 5.11].
And height {QN} (is) equal to height {KL}.
Thus, as base {ABCD} is to base {EFGH}, so height {MN} (is) to height {KL}.
Thus, the bases of cylinders {AO} and {EP} are reciprocally proportional to their heights.

And, so, let the bases of cylinders {AO} and {EP} be reciprocally proportional to their heights, and (thus) let base {ABCD} be to base {EFGH}, as height {MN} (is) to height {KL}.
I say that cylinder {AO} is equal to cylinder {EP}.

For, with the same construction, since as base {ABCD} is to base {EFGH}, so height {MN} (is) to height {KL}, and height {KL} (is) equal to height {QN}, thus, as base {ABCD} (is) to base {EFGH}, so height {MN} will be to height {QN}.
But, as base {ABCD} (is) to base {EFGH}, so cylinder {AO} (is) to cylinder {ES}.
For they are the same height [Prop. 12.11].
And as height {MN} (is) to [height] {QN}, so cylinder {EP} (is) to cylinder {ES} [Prop. 12.13].
Thus, as cylinder {AO} is to cylinder {ES}, so cylinder {EP} (is) to (cylinder) {ES} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, cylinder {AO} (is) equal to cylinder {EP} [Prop. 5.9].
In the same manner, (the proposition can) also (be demonstrated) for the cones.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
