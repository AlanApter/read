Any pyramid having a triangular base is divided into two pyramids having triangular bases (which are) equal, similar to one another, and [similar] to the whole, and into two equal prisms.
And the (sum of the) two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyramid.

Let there be a pyramid whose base is triangle {ABC polygon}, and (whose) apex (is) point {D point}.
I say that pyramid {ABCD given} is divided into two pyramids having triangular bases (which are) equal to one another, and similar to the whole, and into two equal prisms.
And the (sum of the) two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyramid.

For let {AB line}, {BC line}, {CA line}, {AD line}, {DB line}, and {DC line} have been cut in half at points {E point}, {F point}, {G point}, {H point}, {K point}, and {L point} (respectively).
And let {HE line}, {EG line}, {GH line}, {HK line}, {KL line}, {LH line}, {KF line}, and {FG line} have been joined.
Since {AE line} is equal to {EB line}, and {AH line} to {DH line}, {EH line} is thus parallel to {DB line} [Prop. 6.2].
So, for the same (reasons), {HK line} is also parallel to {AB line}.
Thus, {HEBK polygon} is a parallelogram.
Thus, {HK line} is equal to {EB line} [Prop. 1.34].
But, {EB line} is equal to {EA line}.
Thus, {AE line} is also equal to {HK line}.
And {AH line} is also equal to {HD line}.
So the two (straight-lines) {EA line} and {AH line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {KH line} and {HD line}, respectively.
And angle {EAH angle} (is) equal to angle {KHD angle} [Prop. 1.29].
Thus, base {EH line} is equal to base {KD line} [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, triangle {AEH polygon} is equal and similar to triangle {HKD polygon} [Prop. 1.4].
So, for the same (reasons), triangle {AHG polygon} is also equal and similar to triangle {HLD polygon}.
And since {EH line} and {HG line} are two straight-lines joining one another (which are respectively) parallel to two straight-lines joining one another, {KD line} and {DL line}, not being in the same plane, they will contain equal angles [Prop. 11.10].
Thus, angle {EHG angle} is equal to angle {KDL angle}.
And since the two straight-lines {EH line} and {HG line} are equal to the two straight-lines {KD line} and {DL line}, respectively, and angle {EHG angle} is equal to angle {KDL angle}, base {EG line} [is] thus equal to base {KL line} [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, triangle {EHG polygon} is equal and similar to triangle {KDL polygon}.
So, for the same (reasons), triangle {AEG polygon} is also equal and similar to triangle {HKL polygon}.
Thus, the pyramid whose base is triangle {AEG polygon}, and apex the point {H point}, is equal and similar to the pyramid whose base is triangle {HKL polygon}, and apex the point {D point} [Def. 11.10].
And since {HK line} has been drawn parallel to one of the sides, {AB line}, of triangle {ADB polygon}, triangle {ADB polygon} is equiangular to triangle {DHK polygon} [Prop. 1.29], and they have proportional sides.
Thus, triangle {ADB polygon} is similar to triangle {DHK polygon} [Def. 6.1].
So, for the same (reasons), triangle {DBC polygon} is also similar to triangle {DKL polygon}, and {ADC polygon} to {DLH polygon}.
And since two straight-lines joining one another, {BA line} and {AC line}, are parallel to two straight-lines joining one another, {KH line} and {HL line}, not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles [Prop. 11.10].
Thus, angle {BAC angle} is equal to (angle) {KHL angle}.
And as {BA line} is to {AC line}, so {KH line} (is) to {HL line}.
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is similar to triangle {HKL polygon} [Prop. 6.6].
And, thus, the pyramid whose base is triangle {ABC polygon}, and apex the point {D point}, is similar to the pyramid whose base is triangle {HKL polygon}, and apex the point {D point} [Def. 11.9].
But, the pyramid whose base [is] triangle {HKL polygon}, and apex the point {D point}, was shown (to be) similar to the pyramid whose base is triangle {AEG polygon}, and apex the point {H point}.
Thus, each of the pyramids {AEGH given} and {HKLD given} is similar to the whole pyramid {ABCD given}.

And since {BF line} is equal to {FC line}, parallelogram {EBFG polygon} is double triangle {GFC polygon} [Prop. 1.41].
And since, if two prisms (have) equal heights, and the former has a parallelogram as a base, and the latter a triangle, and the parallelogram (is) double the triangle, then the prisms are equal [Prop. 11.39], the prism contained by the two triangles {BKF polygon} and {EHG polygon}, and the three parallelograms {EBFG polygon}, {EBKH polygon}, and {HKFG polygon}, is thus equal to the prism contained by the two triangles {GFC polygon} and {HKL polygon}, and the three parallelograms {KFCL polygon}, {LCGH polygon}, and {HKFG polygon}.
And (it is) clear that each of the prisms whose base (is) parallelogram {EBFG polygon}, and opposite (side) straight-line {HK line}, and whose base (is) triangle {GFC polygon}, and opposite (plane) triangle {HKL polygon}, is greater than each of the pyramids whose bases are triangles {AEG polygon} and {HKL polygon}, and apexes the points {H point} and {D point} (respectively), inasmuch as, if we [also] join the straight-lines {EF line} and {EK line} then the prism whose base (is) parallelogram {EBFG polygon}, and opposite (side) straight-line {HK line}, is greater than the pyramid whose base (is) triangle {EBF polygon}, and apex the point {K point}.
But the pyramid whose base (is) triangle {EBF polygon}, and apex the point {K point}, is equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle {AEG polygon}, and apex point {H point}.
For they are contained by equal and similar planes.
And, hence, the prism whose base (is) parallelogram {EBFG polygon}, and opposite (side) straight-line {HK line}, is greater than the pyramid whose base (is) triangle {AEG polygon}, and apex the point {H point}.
And the prism whose base is parallelogram {EBFG polygon}, and opposite (side) straight-line {HK line}, (is) equal to the prism whose base (is) triangle {GFC polygon}, and opposite (plane) triangle {HKL polygon}.
And the pyramid whose base (is) triangle {AEG polygon}, and apex the point {H point}, is equal to the pyramid whose base (is) triangle {HKL polygon}, and apex the point {D point}.
Thus, the (sum of the) aforementioned two prisms is greater than the (sum of the) aforementioned two pyramids, whose bases (are) triangles {AEG polygon} and {HKL polygon}, and apexes the points {H point} and {D point} (respectively).

Thus, the whole pyramid, whose base (is) triangle {ABC polygon}, and apex the point {D point}, has been divided into two pyramids (which are) equal to one another [and similar to the whole], and into two equal prisms.
And the (sum of the) two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyramid.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
