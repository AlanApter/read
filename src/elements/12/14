Cones and cylinders which are on equal bases are to one another as their heights.

For let EB and FD be cylinders on equal bases, (namely) the circles AB and CD (respectively).
I say that as cylinder EB is to cylinder FD, so axis GH (is) to axis K L.

For let the axis KL have been produced to point N.
And let LN be made equal to axis GH.
And let the cylinder C M have been conceived about axis LN.
Therefore, since cylinders EB and CM have the same height they are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.11].
And the bases are equal to one another.
Thus, cylinders EB and CM are also equal to one another.
And since cylinder FM has been cut by the plane CD, which is parallel to its opposite planes, thus as cylinder CM is to cylinder FD, so axis LN (is) to axis KL [Prop. 12.13].
And cylinder CM is equal to cylinder EB, and axis LN to axis GH.
Thus, as cylinder EB is to cylinder FD, so axis GH (is) to axis KL.
And as cylinder EB (is) to cylinder FD, so cone ABG (is) to cone CDK [Prop. 12.10].
Thus, also, as axis GH (is) to axis KL, so cone ABG (is) to cone CDK, and cylinder EB to cylinder FD.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
