Spheres are to one another in the cubed ratio of their respective diameters.

Let the spheres {ABC} and {DEF} have been conceived, and (let) their diameters (be) {BC} and {EF} (respectively).
I say that sphere {ABC} has to sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF}.

For if sphere {ABC} does not have to sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF} then sphere {ABC} will have to some (sphere) either less than, or greater than, sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF}.
Let it, first of all, have (such a ratio) to a lesser (sphere), {GHK}.
And let {DEF} have been conceived about the same center as {GHK}.
And let a polyhedral solid have been inscribed in the greater sphere {DEF}, not touching the lesser sphere {GHK} on its surface [Prop. 12.17].
And let a polyhedral solid, similar to the polyhedral solid in sphere {DEF}, have also been inscribed in sphere {ABC}.
Thus, the polyhedral solid in sphere {ABC} has to the polyhedral solid in sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF} [Prop. 12.17 corr.].
And sphere {ABC} also has to sphere {GHK} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF}.
Thus, as sphere {ABC} is to sphere {GHK}, so the polyhedral solid in sphere {ABC} (is) to the polyhedral solid is sphere {DEF}.
[Thus], alternately, as sphere {ABC} (is) to the polygon within it, so sphere {GHK} (is) to the polyhedral solid within sphere {DEF} [Prop. 5.16].
And sphere {ABC} (is) greater than the polyhedron within it.
Thus, sphere {GHK} (is) also greater than the polyhedron within sphere {DEF} [Prop. 5.14].
But, (it is) also less.
For it is encompassed by it.
Thus, sphere {ABC} does not have to (a sphere) less than sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that diameter {BC} (has) to {EF}.
So, similarly, we can show that sphere {DEF} does not have to (a sphere) less than sphere {ABC} the cubed ratio that {EF} (has) to {BC} either.

So, I say that sphere {ABC} does not have to some (sphere) greater than sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF} either.

For, if possible, let it have (the cubed ratio) to a greater (sphere), {LMN}.
Thus, inversely, sphere {LMN} (has) to sphere {ABC} the cubed ratio that diameter {EF} (has) to diameter {BC} [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
And as sphere {LMN} (is) to sphere {ABC}, so sphere {DEF} (is) to some (sphere) less than sphere {ABC}, inasmuch as {LMN} is greater than {DEF}, as was shown before [Prop. 12.2 lem.].
And, thus, sphere {DEF} has to some (sphere) less than sphere {ABC} the cubed ratio that {EF} (has) to {BC}.
The very thing was shown (to be) impossible.
Thus, sphere {ABC} does not have to some (sphere) greater than sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF}.
And it was shown that neither (does it have such a ratio) to a lesser (sphere).
Thus, sphere {ABC} has to sphere {DEF} the cubed ratio that {BC} (has) to {EF}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
