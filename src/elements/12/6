Pyramids which are of the same height, and have polygonal bases, are to one another as their bases.

Let there be pyramids of the same height whose bases (are) the polygons ABCDE and FGHKL, and apexes the points M and N (respectively).
I say that as base ABCDE is to base FGHKL, so pyramid ABCDEM (is) to pyramid FGHKLN.

For let AC, AD, FH, and FK have been joined.
Therefore, since ABCM and ACDM are two pyramids having triangular bases and equal height, they are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.5].
Thus, as base ABC is to base ACD, so pyramid ABCM (is) to pyramid ACDM.
And, via composition, as base ABCD (is) to base ACD, so pyramid ABCDM (is) to pyramid ACDM [Prop. 5.18].
But, as base ACD (is) to base ADE, so pyramid ACDM (is) also to pyramid ADEM [Prop. 12.5].
Thus, via equality, as base ABCD (is) to base ADE, so pyramid ABCDM (is) to pyramid ADEM [Prop. 5.22].
And, again, via composition, as base ABCDE (is) to base ADE, so pyramid ABCDEM (is) to pyramid ADEM [Prop. 5.18].
So, similarly, it can also be shown that as base FGHKL (is) to base FGH, so pyramid FGHKLN (is) also to pyramid FGHN.
And since ADEM and FGHN are two pyramids having triangular bases and equal height, thus as base ADE (is) to base FGH, so pyramid ADEM (is) to pyramid FGHN [Prop. 12.5].
But, as base ADE (is) to base ABCDE, so pyramid ADEM (was) to pyramid ABCDEM.
Thus, via equality, as base ABCDE (is) to base FGH, so pyramid ABCDEM (is) also to pyramid FGHN [Prop. 5.22].
But, furthermore, as base FGH (is) to base FGH KL, so pyramid FGHN was also to pyramid FGHKLN.
Thus, via equality, as base ABCDE (is) to base F GHKL, so pyramid ABCDEM (is) also to pyramid FGHKLN [Prop. 5.22].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
