If a cylinder is cut by a plane which is parallel to the opposite planes (of the cylinder) then as the cylinder (is) to the cylinder, so the axis will be to the axis.

For let the cylinder {AD given} have been cut by the plane {GH given} which is parallel to the opposite planes (of the cylinder), {AB given} and {CD given}.
And let the plane {GH given} have met the axis at point {K point}.
I say that as cylinder {BG given} is to cylinder {GD given}, so axis {EK line} (is) to axis {KF line}.

For let axis {EF line} have been produced in each direction to points {L point} and {M point}.
And let any number whatsoever (of lengths), {EN line} and {NL line}, equal to axis {EK line}, be set out (on the axis {EL line}), and any number whatsoever (of lengths), {FO line} and {OM line}, equal to (axis) {FK line}, (on the axis {KM line}).
And let the cylinder {PW given}, whose bases (are) the circles {PQ given} and {VW given}, have been conceived on axis {LM line}.
And let planes parallel to {AB given}, {CD given}, and the bases of cylinder {PW given}, have been produced through points {N point} and {O point}, and let them have made the circles {RS given} and {TU given} around the centers {N point} and {O point} (respectively).
And since axes {LN line}, {NE line}, and {EK line} are equal to one another, the cylinders {QR given}, {RB given}, and {BG given} are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.11].
But the bases are equal.
Thus, the cylinders {QR given}, {RB given}, and {BG given} (are) also equal to one another.
Therefore, since the axes {LN line}, {NE line}, and {EK line} are equal to one another, and the cylinders {QR given}, {RB given}, and {BG given} are also equal to one another, and the number (of the former) is equal to the number (of the latter), thus as many multiples as axis {KL line} is of axis {EK line}, so many multiples is cylinder {QG given} also of cylinder {GB given}.
And so, for the same (reasons), as many multiples as axis {MK line} is of axis {KF line}, so many multiples is cylinder {WG given} also of cylinder {GD given}.
And if axis {KL line} is equal to axis {KM line} then cylinder {QG given} will also be equal to cylinder {GW given}, and if the axis (is) greater than the axis then the cylinder (will also be) greater than the cylinder, and if (the axis is) less then (the cylinder will also be) less.
So, there are four magnitudes—the axes {EK line} and {KF line}, and the cylinders {BG given} and {GD given}—and equal multiples have been taken of axis {EK line} and cylinder {BG given}—(namely), axis {LK line} and cylinder {QG given}—and of axis {KF line} and cylinder {GD given}—(namely), axis {KM line} and cylinder {GW given}.
And it has been shown that if axis {KL line} exceeds axis {KM line} then cylinder {QG given} also exceeds cylinder {GW given}, and if (the axes are) equal then (the cylinders are) equal, and if ({KL line} is) less then ({QG given} is) less.
Thus, as axis {EK line} is to axis {KF line}, so cylinder {BG given} (is) to cylinder {GD given} [Def. 5.5].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
