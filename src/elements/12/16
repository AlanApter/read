There being two circles about the same center, to inscribe an equilateral and even-sided polygon in the greater circle, not touching the lesser circle.

Let {ABCD} and {EFGH} be the given two circles, about the same center, {K}.
So, it is necessary to inscribe an equilateral and even-sided polygon in the greater circle {ABCD}, not touching circle {EFGH}.

Let the straight-line {BKD} have been drawn through the center {K}.
And let {GA} have been drawn, at right-angles to the straight-line {BD}, through point {G}, and let it have been drawn through to {C}.
Thus, {AC} touches circle {EFGH} [Prop. 3.16 corr.].
So, (by) cutting circumference {BAD} in half, and the half of it in half, and doing this continually, we will (eventually) leave a circumference less than {AD} [Prop. 10.1].
Let it have been left, and let it be {LD}.
And let {LM} have been drawn, from {L}, perpendicular to {BD}, and let it have been drawn through to {N}.
And let {LD} and {DN} have been joined.
Thus, {LD} is equal to {DN} [Props. 3.3, 1.4].
And since {LN} is parallel to {AC} [Prop. 1.28], and {AC} touches circle {EFGH}, {LN} thus does not touch circle {EFGH}.
Thus, even more so, {LD} and {DN} do not touch circle {EFGH}.
And if we continuously insert (straight-lines) equal to straight-line {LD} into circle {ABCD} [Prop. 4.1] then an equilateral and even-sided polygon, not touching the lesser circle {EFGH}, will have been inscribed in circle {ABCD}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
