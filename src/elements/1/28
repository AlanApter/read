If a straight-line falling across two straight-lines makes the external angle equal to the internal and opposite angle on the same side, or (makes) the (sum of the) internal (angles) on the same side equal to two right-angles, then the (two) straight-lines will be parallel to one another.

For let {EF line}, falling across the two straight-lines {AB line} and {CD line}, make the external angle {EGB angle} equal to the internal and opposite angle {GHD angle}, or the (sum of the) internal (angles) on the same side, {BGH angle} and {GHD angle}, equal to two right-angles.
I say that {AB line} is parallel to {CD line}.

For since (in the first case) {EGB angle} is equal to {GHD angle}, but {EGB angle} is equal to {AGH angle} [Prop. 1.15], {AGH angle} is thus also equal to {GHD angle}.
And they are alternate (angles).
Thus, {AB line} is parallel to {CD line} [Prop. 1.27].

Again, since (in the second case, the sum of) {BGH angle} and {GHD angle} is equal to two right-angles, and (the sum of) {AGH angle} and {BGH angle} is also equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13], (the sum of) {AGH angle} and {BGH angle} is thus equal to (the sum of) {BGH angle} and {GHD angle}.
Let {BGH angle} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remainder {AGH angle} is equal to the remainder {GHD angle}.
And they are alternate (angles).
Thus, {AB line} is parallel to {CD line} [Prop. 1.27].

Thus, if a straight-line falling across two straight-lines makes the external angle equal to the internal and opposite angle on the same side, or (makes) the (sum of the) internal (angles) on the same side equal to two right-angles, then the (two) straight-lines will be parallel (to one another).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
