To construct a triangle from three straight-lines which are equal to three given [straight-lines].
It is necessary for (the sum of) two (of the straight-lines) to be greater than the remaining (one), (the straight-lines) being taken up in any (possible way) [on account of the (fact that) for every triangle (the sum of any) two sides is greater than the remaining (one), (the sides) being taken up in any (possible way) [Prop. 1.20] ].

Let {A given}, {B given}, and {C given} be the three given straight-lines, of which let (the sum of any) two be greater than the remaining (one), (the straight-lines) being taken up in (any possible way).
(Thus), (the sum of) {A given} and {B given} (is greater) than {C given}, (the sum of) {A given} and {C given} than {B given}, and also (the sum of) {B given} and {C given} than {A given}.
So it is required to construct a triangle from (straight-lines) equal to {A given}, {B given}, and {C given}.

Let some straight-line {DE line} be set out, terminated at {D point}, and infinite in the direction of {E point}.
And let {DF line} made equal to {A given} [Prop. 1.3], and {FG line} equal to {B given} [Prop. 1.3], and {GH line} equal to {C given} [Prop. 1.3].
And let the circle {DKL circle F} have been drawn with center {F point} and radius {FD line}.
Again, let the circle {KLH circle G} have been drawn with center {G point} and radius {GH line}.
And let {KF line} and {KG line} have been joined.
I say that the triangle {KFG polygon} has been constructed from three straight-lines equal to {A given}, {B given}, and {C given}.

For since point {F point} is the center of the circle {DKL circle F}, {FD line} is equal to {FK line}.
But, {FD line} is equal to {A given}.
Thus, {KF line} is also equal to {A given}.
Again, since point {G point} is the center of the circle {LKH circle G}, {GH line} is equal to {GK line}.
But, {GH line} is equal to {C given}.
Thus, {KG line} is also equal to {C given}.
And {FG line} is equal to {B given}.
Thus, the three straight-lines {KF line}, {FG line}, and {GK line} are equal to {A given}, {B given}, and {C given} (respectively).

Thus, the triangle {KFG polygon} has been constructed from the three straight-lines {KF line}, {FG line}, and {GK line}, which are equal to the three given straight-lines {A given}, {B given}, and {C given} (respectively).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
