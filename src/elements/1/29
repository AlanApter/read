A straight-line falling across parallel straight-lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the external (angle) equal to the internal and opposite (angle), and the (sum of the) internal (angles) on the same side equal to two right-angles.

For let the straight-line {EF line} fall across the parallel straight-lines {AB line} and {CD line}.
I say that it makes the alternate angles, {AGH angle} and {GHD angle}, equal, the external angle {EGB angle} equal to the internal and opposite (angle) {GHD angle}, and the (sum of the) internal (angles) on the same side, {BGH angle} and {GHD angle}, equal to two right-angles.

For if {AGH angle} is unequal to {GHD angle} then one of them is greater.
Let {AGH angle} be greater.
Let {BGH angle} have been added to both.
Thus, (the sum of) {AGH angle} and {BGH angle} is greater than (the sum of) {BGH angle} and {GHD angle}.
But, (the sum of) {AGH angle} and {BGH angle} is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
Thus, (the sum of) {BGH angle} and {GHD angle} is [also] less than two right-angles.
But (straight-lines) being produced to infinity from (internal angles whose sum is) less than two right-angles meet together [Post. 5].
Thus, {AB line} and {CD line}, being produced to infinity, will meet together.
But they do not meet, on account of them (initially) being assumed parallel (to one another) [Def. 1.23].
Thus, {AGH angle} is not unequal to {GHD angle}.
Thus, (it is) equal.
But, {AGH angle} is equal to {EGB angle} [Prop. 1.15].
And {EGB angle} is thus also equal to {GHD angle}.
Let {BGH angle} be added to both.
Thus, (the sum of) {EGB angle} and {BGH angle} is equal to (the sum of) {BGH angle} and {GHD angle}.

But, (the sum of) {EGB angle} and {BGH angle} is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
Thus, (the sum of) {BGH angle} and {GHD angle} is also equal to two right-angles.

Thus, a straight-line falling across parallel straight-lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the external (angle) equal to the internal and opposite (angle), and the (sum of the) internal (angles) on the same side equal to two right-angles.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
