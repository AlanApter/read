For isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another, and if the equal sides are produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one another.

Let {ABC polygon} be an isosceles triangle having the side {AB line} equal to the side {AC line}, and let the straight-lines {BD line} and {CE line} have been produced in a straight-line with {AB line} and {AC line} (respectively) [Post. 2].
I say that the angle {ABC angle} is equal to {ACB angle},
and (angle) {CBD angle} to {BCE angle}.

For let the point {F point} have been taken somewhere on {BD line}, and let {AG line} have been cut off from the greater {AE line}, equal to the lesser {AF line} [Prop. 1.3].
Also, let the straight-lines {FC line} and {GB line} have been joined [Post. 1].

In fact, since {AF line} is equal to {AG line}, and {AB line} to {AC line}, the two (straight-lines) {FA line}, {AC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {GA line}, {AB line}, respectively.
They also encompass a common angle {FAG angle}.
Thus, the base {FC line} is equal to the base {GB line}, and the triangle {AFC polygon} will be equal to the triangle {AGB polygon}, and the remaining angles subtendend by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
(That is) {ACF angle} to {ABG angle}, and {AFC angle} to {AGB angle}.
And since the whole of {AF line} is equal to the whole of {AG line}, within which {AB line} is equal to {AC line}, the remainder {BF line} is thus equal to the remainder {CG line} [C.N. 3].
But {FC line} was also shown (to be) equal to {GB line}.
So the two (straight-lines) {BF line}, {FC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {CG line}, {GB line}, respectively, and the angle {BFC angle} (is) equal to the angle {CGB angle}, and the base {BC line} is common to them.
Thus, the triangle {BFC polygon} will be equal to the triangle {CGB polygon}, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, {FBC angle} is equal to {GCB angle}, and {BCF angle} to {CBG angle}.
Therefore, since the whole angle {ABG angle} was shown (to be) equal to the whole angle {ACF angle}, within which {CBG angle} is equal to {BCF angle}, the remainder {ABC angle} is thus equal to the remainder {ACB angle} [C.N. 3].
And they are at the base of triangle {ABC polygon}.
And {FBC angle} was also shown (to be) equal to {GCB angle}.
And they are under the base.

Thus, for isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another, and if the equal sides are produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
