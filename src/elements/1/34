For parallelogrammic figures, the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and a diagonal cuts them in half.

Let {ACDB polygon} be a parallelogrammic figure, and {BC line} its diagonal.
I say that for parallelogram {ACDB polygon}, the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diagonal {BC line} cuts it in half.

For since {AB line} is parallel to {CD line}, and the straight-line {BC line} has fallen across them, the alternate angles {ABC angle} and {BCD angle} are equal to one another [Prop. 1.29].
Again, since {AC line} is parallel to {BD line}, and {BC line} has fallen across them, the alternate angles {ACB angle} and {CBD angle} are equal to one another [Prop. 1.29].]
So {ABC polygon} and {BCD polygon} are two triangles having the two angles {ABC angle} and {BCA angle} equal to the two (angles) {BCD angle} and {CBD angle}, respectively, and one side equal to one sideâ€”the (one) common to the equal angles, (namely) {BC line}.
Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remaining (sides), and the remaining angle (equal) to the remaining angle [Prop. 1.26].
Thus, side {AB line} is equal to {CD line}, and {AC line} to {BD line}.
Furthermore, angle {BAC angle} is equal to {CDB angle}.
And since angle {ABC angle} is equal to {BCD angle}, and {CBD angle} to {ACB angle}, the whole (angle) {ABD angle} is thus equal to the whole (angle) {ACD angle}.
And {BAC angle} was also shown (to be) equal to {CDB angle}.

Thus, for parallelogrammic figures, the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another.

And, I also say that a diagonal cuts them in half.
For since {AB line} is equal to {CD line}, and {BC line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AB line}, {BC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DC line}, {CB line}, respectively.
And angle {ABC angle} is equal to angle {BCD angle}.
Thus, the base {AC line} (is) also equal to {DB line} [Prop. 1.4].
Also, triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {BCD polygon} [Prop. 1.4].

Thus, the diagonal {BC line} cuts the parallelogram {ACDB polygon} in half.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
