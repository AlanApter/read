If an odd number is prime to some number then it will also be prime to its double.

For let the odd number {A magnitude} be prime to some number {B magnitude}.
And let {C magnitude} be double {B magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} is [also] prime to {C magnitude}.

For if [{A magnitude} and {C magnitude}] are not prime (to one another) then some number will measure them.
Let it measure (them), and let it be {D magnitude}.
And {A magnitude} is odd.
Thus, {D magnitude} (is) also odd.
And since {D magnitude}, which is odd, measures {C magnitude}, and {C magnitude} is even, [{D magnitude}] will thus also measure half of {C magnitude} [Prop. 9.30].
And {B magnitude} is half of {C magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} measures {B magnitude}.
And it also measures {A magnitude}.
Thus, {D magnitude} measures (both) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, (despite) them being prime to one another.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {A magnitude} is not unprime to {C magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} and {C magnitude} are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
