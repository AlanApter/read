The (set of all) prime numbers is more numerous than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} be the assigned prime numbers.
I say that the (set of all) primes numbers is more numerous than {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.

For let the least number measured by {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} have been taken, and let it be {DE magnitude} [Prop. 7.36].
And let the unit {DF magnitude} have been added to {DE magnitude}.
So {EF magnitude} is either prime, or not.
Let it, first of all, be prime.
Thus, the (set of) prime numbers {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {EF magnitude}, (which is) more numerous than {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, has been found.

And so let {EF magnitude} not be prime.
Thus, it is measured by some prime number [Prop. 7.31].
Let it be measured by the prime (number) {G magnitude}.
I say that {G magnitude} is not the same as any of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
For, if possible, let it be (the same).
And {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (all) measure {DE magnitude}.
Thus, {G magnitude} will also measure {DE magnitude}.
And it also measures {EF magnitude}.
(So) {G magnitude} will also measure the remainder, unit {DF magnitude}, (despite) being a number [Prop. 7.28].
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, {G magnitude} is not the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
And it was assumed (to be) prime.
Thus, the (set of) prime numbers {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {G magnitude}, (which is) more numerous than the assigned multitude (of prime numbers), {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, has been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
