For two given numbers, to investigate whether it is possible to find a third (number) proportional to them.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be the two given numbers.
And let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third (number) proportional to them.

So {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are either prime to one another, or not.
And if they are prime to one another then it has (already) been show that it is impossible to find a third (number) proportional to them [Prop. 9.16].

And so let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} not be prime to one another.
And let {B magnitude} make {C magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
So {A magnitude} either measures, or does not measure, {C magnitude}.
Let it first of all measure ({C magnitude}) according to {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
But, in fact, {B magnitude} has also made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude}, {D magnitude} is equal to the (square) on {B magnitude}.
Thus, as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, (so) {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
Thus, a third number has been found proportional to {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, (namely) {D magnitude}.

And so let {A magnitude} not measure {C magnitude}.
I say that it is impossible to find a third number proportional to {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}.
For, if possible, let it have been found, (and let it be) {D magnitude}.
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude}, {D magnitude} is equal to the (square) on {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
And the (square) on {B magnitude} is {C magnitude}.
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude}, {D magnitude} is equal to {C magnitude}.
Hence, {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} measures {C magnitude} according to {D magnitude}.
But ({A magnitude}) was, in fact, also assumed (to be) not measuring ({C magnitude}).
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, it is not possible to find a third number proportional to {A magnitude}, {B magnitude} when {A magnitude} does not measure {C magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
