Planes to which the same straight-line is at right-angles will be parallel planes.

For let some straight-line AB be at right-angles to each of the planes CD and EF.
I say that the planes are parallel.

For, if not, being produced, they will meet.
Let them have met.
So they will make a straight-line as a common section [Prop. 11.3].
Let them have made GH.
And let some random point K have been taken on GH.
And let AK and BK have been joined.

And since AB is at right-angles to the plane EF, AB is thus also at right-angles to BK, which is a straight-line in the produced plane EF [Def. 11.3].
Thus, angle ABK is a right-angle.
So, for the same (reasons), BAK is also a right-angle.
So the (sum of the) two angles ABK and BAK in the triangle ABK is equal to two right-angles.
The very thing is impossible [Prop. 1.17].
Thus, planes CD and EF, being produced, will not meet.
Planes CD and EF are thus parallel [Def. 11.8].

Thus, planes to which the same straight-line is at right-angles are parallel planes.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
