If there are two equal plane angles, and raised straight-lines are stood on the apexes of them, containing equal angles respectively with the original straight-lines (forming the angles), and random points are taken on the raised (straight-lines), and perpendiculars are drawn from them to the planes in which the original angles are, and straight-lines are joined from the points created in the planes to the (vertices of the) original angles, then they will enclose equal angles with the raised (straight-lines).

Let {BAC angle} and {EDF angle} be two equal rectilinear angles.
And let the raised straight-lines {AG line} and {DM line} have been stood on points {A point} and {D point}, containing equal angles respectively with the original straight-lines.
(That is) {MDE angle} (equal) to {GAB angle}, and {MDF angle} (to) {GAC angle}.
And let the random points {G point} and {M point} have been taken on {AG line} and {DM line} (respectively).
And let the {GL line} and {MN line} have been drawn from points {G point} and {M point} perpendicular to the planes through {BAC polygon} and {EDF polygon} (respectively).
And let them have joined the planes at points {L point} and {N point} (respectively).
And let {LA line} and {ND line} have been joined.
I say that angle {GAL angle} is equal to angle {MDN angle}.

Let {AH line} be made equal to {DM line}.
And let {HK line} have been drawn through point {H point} parallel to {GL line}.
And {GL line} is perpendicular to the plane through {BAC polygon}.
Thus, {HK line} is also perpendicular to the plane through {BAC polygon} [Prop. 11.8].
And let {KC line}, {NF line}, {KB line}, and {NE line} have been drawn from points {K point} and {N point} perpendicular to the straight-lines {AC line}, {DF line}, {AB line}, and {DE line}.
And let {HC line}, {CB line}, {MF line}, and {FE line} have been joined.
Since the (square) on {HA line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {HK line} and {KA line} [Prop. 1.47], and the (sum of the squares) on {KC line} and {CA line} is equal to the (square) on {KA line} [Prop. 1.47], thus the (square) on {HA line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {HK line}, {KC line}, and {CA line}.
And the (square) on {HC line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {HK line} and {KC line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (square) on {HA line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {HC line} and {CA line}.
Thus, angle {HCA angle} is a right-angle [Prop. 1.48].
So, for the same (reasons), angle {DFM angle} is also a right-angle.
Thus, angle {ACH angle} is equal to (angle) {DFM angle}.
And {HAC angle} is also equal to {MDF angle}.
So, {MDF polygon} and {HAC polygon} are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles, respectively, and one side equal to one side---(namely), that subtending one of the equal angles ---(that is), {HA line} (equal) to {MD line}.
Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, respectively [Prop. 1.26].
Thus, {AC line} is equal to {DF line}.
So, similarly, we can show that {AB line} is also equal to {DE line}.
Therefore, since {AC line} is equal to {DF line}, and {AB line} to {DE line}, so the two (straight-lines) {CA line} and {AB line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {FD line} and {DE line} (respectively).
But, angle {CAB angle} is also equal to angle {FDE angle}.
Thus, base {BC line} is equal to base {EF line}, and triangle ({ACB polygon}) to triangle ({DFE polygon}), and the remaining angles to the remaining angles (respectively) [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, angle {ACB angle} (is) equal to {DFE angle}.
And the right-angle {ACK angle} is also equal to the right-angle {DFN angle}.
Thus, the remainder {BCK angle} is equal to the remainder {EFN angle}.
So, for the same (reasons), {CBK angle} is also equal to {FEN angle}.
So, {BCK polygon} and {EFN polygon} are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles, respectively, and one side equal to one side—(namely), that by the equal angles—(that is), {BC line} (equal) to {EF line}.
Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides (respectively) [Prop. 1.26].
Thus, {CK line} is equal to {FN line}.
And {AC line} (is) also equal to {DF line}.
So, the two (straight-lines) {AC line} and {CK line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DF line} and {FN line} (respectively).
And they enclose right-angles.
Thus, base {AK line} is equal to base {DN line} [Prop. 1.4].
And since {AH line} is equal to {DM line}, the (square) on {AH line} is also equal to the (square) on {DM line}.
But, the the (sum of the squares) on {AK line} and {KH line} is equal to the (square) on {AH line}.
For angle {AKH angle} (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
And the (sum of the squares) on {DN line} and {NM line} (is) equal to the square on {DM line}.
For angle {DNM angle} (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {AK line} and {KH line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {DN line} and {NM line}, of which the (square) on {AK line} is equal to the (square) on {DN line}.
Thus, the remaining (square) on {KH line} is equal to the (square) on {NM line}.
Thus, {HK line} (is) equal to {MN line}.
And since the two (straight-lines) {HA line} and {AK line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {MD line} and {DN line}, respectively, and base {HK line} was shown (to be) equal to base {MN line}, angle {HAK angle} is thus equal to angle {MDN angle} [Prop. 1.8].

Thus, if there are two equal plane angles, and so on of the proposition.
[(Which is) the very thing it was required to show].

Corollary

So, it is clear, from this, that if there are two equal plane angles, and equal raised straight-lines are stood on them (at their apexes), containing equal angles respectively with the original straight-lines (forming the angles), then the perpendiculars drawn from (the raised ends of) them to the planes in which the original angles lie are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
