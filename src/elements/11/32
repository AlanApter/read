Parallelepiped solids which (have) the same height are to one another as their bases.

Let {AB} and {CD} be parallelepiped solids (having) the same height.
I say that the parallelepiped solids {AB} and {CD} are to one another as their bases.
That is to say, as base {AE} is to base {CF}, so solid {AB} (is) to solid {CD}.

For let {FH}, equal to {AE}, have been applied to {FG} (in the angle {FGH} equal to angle {LCG}) [Prop. 1.45].
And let the parallelepiped solid {GK}, (having) the same height as {CD}, have been completed on the base {FH}.
So solid {AB} is equal to solid {GK}.
For they are on the equal bases {AE} and {FH}, and (have) the same height [Prop. 11.31].
And since the parallelepiped solid {CK} has been cut by the plane {DG}, which is parallel to the opposite planes (of {CK}), thus as the base {CF} is to the base {FH}, so the solid {CD} (is) to the solid {DH} [Prop. 11.25].
And base {FH} (is) equal to base {AE}, and solid {GK} to solid {AB}.
And thus as base {AE} is to base {CF}, so solid {AB} (is) to solid {CD}.

Thus, parallelepiped solids which (have) the same height are to one another as their bases.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
