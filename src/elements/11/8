If two straight-lines are parallel, and one of them is at right-angles to some plane, then the remaining (one) will also be at right-angles to the same plane.

Let {AB} and {CD} be two parallel straight-lines, and let one of them, {AB}, be at right-angles to a reference plane.
I say that the remaining (one), {CD}, will also be at right-angles to the same plane.

For let {AB} and {CD} meet the reference plane at points {B} and {D} (respectively).
And let {BD} have been joined.
{AB}, {CD}, and {BD} are thus in one plane [Prop. 11.7].
Let {DE} have been drawn at right-angles to {BD} in the reference plane, and let {DE} be made equal to {AB}, and let {BE}, {AE}, and {AD} have been joined.

And since {AB} is at right-angles to the reference plane, {AB} is thus also at right-angles to all of the straight-lines joined to it which are in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
Thus, the angles {ABD} and {ABE} [are] each right-angles.
And since the straight-line {BD} has met the parallel (straight-lines) {AB} and {CD}, the (sum of the) angles {ABD} and {CDB} is thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
And {ABD} (is) a right-angle.
Thus, {CDB} (is) also a right-angle.
{CD} is thus at right-angles to {BD}.
And since {AB} is equal to {DE}, and {BD} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AB} and {BD} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {ED} and {DB} (respectively).
And angle {ABD} (is) equal to angle {EDB}.
For each (is) a right-angle.
Thus, the base {AD} (is) equal to the base {BE} [Prop. 1.4].
And since {AB} is equal to {DE}, and {BE} to {AD}, the two (sides) {AB}, {BE} are equal to the two (sides) {ED}, {DA}, respectively.
And their base {AE} is common.
Thus, angle {ABE} is equal to angle {EDA} [Prop. 1.8].
And {ABE} (is) a right-angle.
{EDA} (is) thus also a right-angle.
Thus, {ED} is at right-angles to {AD}.
And it is also at right-angles to {DB}.
Thus, {ED} is also at right-angles to the plane through {BD} and {DA} [Prop. 11.4].
And {ED} will thus make right-angles with all of the straight-lines joined to it which are also in the plane through {BDA}.
And {DC} is in the plane through {BDA}, inasmuch as {AB} and {BD} are in the plane through {BDA} [Prop. 11.2], and in which(ever plane) {AB} and {BD} (are found), {DC} is also (found).
Thus, {ED} is at right-angles to {DC}.
Hence, {CD} is also at right-angles to {DE}.
And {CD} is also at right-angles to {BD}.
Thus, {CD} is standing at right-angles to two straight-lines, {DE} and {DB}, which meet one another, at the (point) of section, {D}.
Hence, {CD} is also at right-angles to the plane through {DE} and {DB} [Prop. 11.4].
And the plane through {DE} and {DB} is the reference (plane).
{CD} is thus at right-angles to the reference plane.

Thus, if two straight-lines are parallel, and one of them is at right-angles to some plane, then the remaining (one) will also be at right-angles to the same plane.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
