If two straight-lines are parallel, and one of them is at right-angles to some plane, then the remaining (one) will also be at right-angles to the same plane.

Let {AB line} and {CD line} be two parallel straight-lines, and let one of them, {AB line}, be at right-angles to a reference plane.
I say that the remaining (one), {CD line}, will also be at right-angles to the same plane.

For let {AB line} and {CD line} meet the reference plane at points {B point} and {D point} (respectively).
And let {BD line} have been joined.
{AB line}, {CD line}, and {BD line} are thus in one plane [Prop. 11.7].
Let {DE line} have been drawn at right-angles to {BD line} in the reference plane, and let {DE line} be made equal to {AB line}, and let {BE line}, {AE line}, and {AD line} have been joined.

And since {AB line} is at right-angles to the reference plane, {AB line} is thus also at right-angles to all of the straight-lines joined to it which are in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
Thus, the angles {ABD angle} and {ABE angle} [are] each right-angles.
And since the straight-line {BD line} has met the parallel (straight-lines) {AB line} and {CD line}, the (sum of the) angles {ABD angle} and {CDB angle} is thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
And {ABD angle} (is) a right-angle.
Thus, {CDB angle} (is) also a right-angle.
{CD line} is thus at right-angles to {BD line}.
And since {AB line} is equal to {DE line}, and {BD line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AB line} and {BD line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {ED line} and {DB line} (respectively).
And angle {ABD angle} (is) equal to angle {EDB angle}.
For each (is) a right-angle.
Thus, the base {AD line} (is) equal to the base {BE line} [Prop. 1.4].
And since {AB line} is equal to {DE line}, and {BE line} to {AD line}, the two (sides) {AB line}, {BE line} are equal to the two (sides) {ED line}, {DA line}, respectively.
And their base {AE line} is common.
Thus, angle {ABE angle} is equal to angle {EDA angle} [Prop. 1.8].
And {ABE angle} (is) a right-angle.
{EDA angle} (is) thus also a right-angle.
Thus, {ED line} is at right-angles to {AD line}.
And it is also at right-angles to {DB line}.
Thus, {ED line} is also at right-angles to the plane through {BD line} and {DA line} [Prop. 11.4].
And {ED line} will thus make right-angles with all of the straight-lines joined to it which are also in the plane through {BDA polygon}.
And {DC line} is in the plane through {BDA polygon}, inasmuch as {AB line} and {BD line} are in the plane through {BDA polygon} [Prop. 11.2], and in which(ever plane) {AB line} and {BD line} (are found), {DC line} is also (found).
Thus, {ED line} is at right-angles to {DC line}.
Hence, {CD line} is also at right-angles to {DE line}.
And {CD line} is also at right-angles to {BD line}.
Thus, {CD line} is standing at right-angles to two straight-lines, {DE line} and {DB line}, which meet one another, at the (point) of section, {D point}.
Hence, {CD line} is also at right-angles to the plane through {DE line} and {DB line} [Prop. 11.4].
And the plane through {DE line} and {DB line} is the reference (plane).
{CD line} is thus at right-angles to the reference plane.

Thus, if two straight-lines are parallel, and one of them is at right-angles to some plane, then the remaining (one) will also be at right-angles to the same plane.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
