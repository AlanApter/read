Two (different) straight-lines cannot be set up at the same point at right-angles to the same plane, on the same side.

For, if possible, let the two straight-lines {AB line} and {AC line} have been set up at the same point {A point} at right-angles to the reference plane, on the same side.
And let the plane through {BA line} and {AC line} have been drawn.
So it will make a straight cutting (passing) through (point) {A point} in the reference plane [Prop. 11.3].
Let it have made {DAE line}.
Thus, {AB line}, {AC line}, and {DAE line} are straight-lines in one plane.
And since {CA line} is at right-angles to the reference plane, it will thus also make right-angles with all of the straight-lines joined to it which are also in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
And {DAE line}, which is in the reference plane, is joined to it.
Thus, angle {CAE angle} is a right-angle.
So, for the same (reasons), {BAE angle} is also a right-angle.
Thus, {CAE angle} (is) equal to {BAE angle}.
And they are in one plane.
The very thing is impossible.

Thus, two (different) straight-lines cannot be set up at the same point at right-angles to the same plane, on the same side.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
