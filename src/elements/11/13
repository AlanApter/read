Two (different) straight-lines cannot be set up at the same point at right-angles to the same plane, on the same side.

For, if possible, let the two straight-lines AB and AC have been set up at the same point A at right-angles to the reference plane, on the same side.
And let the plane through BA and AC have been drawn.
So it will make a straight cutting (passing) through (point) A in the reference plane [Prop. 11.3].
Let it have made DAE.
Thus, AB, AC, and DAE are straight-lines in one plane.
And since CA is at right-angles to the reference plane, it will thus also make right-angles with all of the straight-lines joined to it which are also in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
And DAE, which is in the reference plane, is joined to it.
Thus, angle CAE is a right-angle.
So, for the same (reasons), BAE is also a right-angle.
Thus, CAE (is) equal to BAE.
And they are in one plane.
The very thing is impossible.

Thus, two (different) straight-lines cannot be set up at the same point at right-angles to the same plane, on the same side.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
