If three straight-lines are (continuously) proportional then the parallelepiped solid (formed) from the three (straight-lines) is equal to the equilateral parallelepiped solid on the middle (straight-line which is) equiangular to the aforementioned (parallelepiped solid).

Let {A}, {B}, and {C} be three (continuously) proportional straight-lines, (such that) as {A} (is) to {B}, so {B} (is) to {C}.
I say that the (parallelepiped) solid (formed) from {A}, {B}, and {C} is equal to the equilateral solid on {B} (which is) equiangular with the aforementioned (solid).

Let the solid angle at {E}, contained by {DEG}, {GEF}, and {FED}, be set out.
And let {DE}, {GE}, and {EF} each be made equal to {B}.
And let the parallelepiped solid {EK} have been completed.
And (let) {LM} (be made) equal to {A}.
And let the solid angle contained by {NLO}, {OLM}, and {MLN} have been constructed on the straight-line {LM}, and at the point {L} on it, (so as to be) equal to the solid angle {E} [Prop. 11.23].
And let {LO} be made equal to {B}, and {LN} equal to {C}.
And since as {A} (is) to {B}, so {B} (is) to {C}, and {A} (is) equal to {LM}, and {B} to each of {LO} and {ED}, and {C} to {LN}, thus as {LM} (is) to {EF}, so {DE} (is) to {LN}.
And (so) the sides around the equal angles {NLM} and {DEF} are reciprocally proportional.
Thus, parallelogram {MN} is equal to parallelogram {DF} [Prop. 6.14].
And since the two plane rectilinear angles {DEF} and {NLM} are equal, and the raised straight-lines stood on them (at their apexes), {LO} and {EG}, are equal to one another, and contain equal angles respectively with the original straight-lines (forming the angles), the perpendiculars drawn from points {G} and {O} to the planes through {NLM} and {DEF} (respectively) are thus equal to one another [Prop. 11.35 corr.].
Thus, the solids {LH} and {EK} (have) the same height.
And parallelepiped solids on equal bases, and with the same height, are equal to one another [Prop. 11.31].
Thus, solid {HL} is equal to solid {EK}.
And {LH} is the solid (formed) from {A}, {B}, and {C}, and {EK} the solid on {B}.
Thus, the parallelepiped solid (formed) from {A}, {B}, and {C} is equal to the equilateral solid on {B} (which is) equiangular with the aforementioned (solid).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
