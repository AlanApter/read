To describe a parallelepiped solid similar, and similarly laid out, to a given parallelepiped solid on a given straight-line.

Let the given straight-line be {AB}, and the given parallelepiped solid {CD}.
So, it is necessary to describe a parallelepiped solid similar, and similarly laid out, to the given parallelepiped solid {CD} on the given straight-line {AB}.

For, let a (solid angle) contained by the (plane angles) {BAH}, {HAK}, and {KAB} have been constructed, equal to solid angle at {C}, on the straight-line {AB} at the point {A} on it [Prop. 11.26], such that angle {BAH} is equal to {ECF}, and {BAK} to {ECG}, and {KAH} to {GCF}.
And let it have been contrived that as {EC} (is) to {CG}, so {BA} (is) to {AK}, and as {GC} (is) to {CF}, so {KA} (is) to {AH} [Prop. 6.12].
And thus, via equality, as {EC} is to {CF}, so {BA} (is) to {AH} [Prop. 5.22].
And let the parallelogram {HB} have been completed, and the solid {AL}.

And since as {EC} is to {CG}, so {BA} (is) to {AK}, and the sides about the equal angles {ECG} and {BAK} are (thus) proportional, the parallelogram {GE} is thus similar to the parallelogram {KB}.
So, for the same (reasons), the parallelogram {KH} is also similar to the parallelogram {GF}, and, further, {FE} (is similar) to {HB}.
Thus, three of the parallelograms of solid {CD} are similar to three of the parallelograms of solid {AL}.
But, the (former) three are equal and similar to the three opposite, and the (latter) three are equal and similar to the three opposite.
Thus, the whole solid {CD} is similar to the whole solid {AL} [Def. 11.9].

Thus, {AL}, similar, and similarly laid out, to the given parallelepiped solid {CD}, has been described on the given straight-lines {AB}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
