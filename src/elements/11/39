If there are two equal height prisms, and one has a parallelogram, and the other a triangle, (as a) base, and the parallelogram is double the triangle, then the prisms will be equal.

Let {ABCDEF} and {GHKLMN} be two equal height prisms, and let the former have the parallelogram {AF}, and the latter the triangle {GHK}, as a base.
And let parallelogram {AF} be twice triangle {GHK}.
I say that prism {ABCDEF} is equal to prism {GHKLMN}.

For let the solids {AO} and {GP} have been completed.
Since parallelogram {AF} is double triangle {GHK}, and parallelogram {HK} is also double triangle {GHK} [Prop. 1.34], parallelogram {AF} is thus equal to parallelogram {HK}.
And parallelepiped solids which are on equal bases, and (have) the same height, are equal to one another [Prop. 11.31].
Thus, solid {AO} is equal to solid {GP}.
And prism {ABCDEF} is half of solid {AO}, and prism {GHKLMN} half of solid {GP} [Prop. 11.28].
Prism {ABCDEF} is thus equal to prism {GHKLMN}.

Thus, if there are two equal height prisms, and one has a parallelogram, and the other a triangle, (as a) base, and the parallelogram is double the triangle, then the prisms are equal.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
