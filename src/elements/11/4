If a straight-line is set up at right-angles to two straight-lines cutting one another, at the common point of section, then it will also be at right-angles to the plane (passing) through them (both).

For let some straight-line {EF} have (been) set up at right-angles to two straight-lines, {AB} and {CD}, cutting one another at point {E}, at {E}.
I say that {EF} is also at right-angles to the plane (passing) through {AB} and {CD}.

For let {AE}, {EB}, {CE} and {ED} have been cut off from (the two straight-lines so as to be) equal to one another.
And let {GEH} have been drawn, at random, through {E} (in the plane passing through {AB} and {CD}).
And let {AD} and {CB} have been joined.
And, furthermore, let {FA}, {FG}, {FD}, {FC}, {FH}, and {FB} have been joined from the random (point) {F} (on {EF}).

For since the two (straight-lines) {AE} and {ED} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {CE} and {EB}, and they enclose equal angles [Prop. 1.15], the base {AD} is thus equal to the base {CB}, and triangle {AED} will be equal to triangle {CEB} [Prop. 1.4].
Hence, the angle {DAE} [is] equal to the angle {EBC}.
And the angle {AEG} (is) also equal to the angle {BEH} [Prop. 1.15].
So {AGE} and {BEH} are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles, respectively, and one side equal to one side---(namely), those by the equal angles, {AE} and {EB}.
Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides [Prop. 1.26].
Thus, {GE} (is) equal to {EH}, and {AG} to {BH}
And since {AE} is equal to {EB}, and {FE} is common and at right-angles, the base {FA} is thus equal to the base {FB} [Prop. 1.4].
So, for the same (reasons), {FC} is also equal to {FD}.
And since {AD} is equal to {CB}, and {FA} is also equal to {FB}, the two (straight-lines) {FA} and {AD} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {FB} and {BC}, respectively.
And the base {FD} was shown (to be) equal to the base {FC}.
Thus, the angle {FAD} is also equal to the angle {FBC} [Prop. 1.8].
And, again, since {AG} was shown (to be) equal to {BH}, but {FA} (is) also equal to {FB}, the two (straight-lines) {FA} and {AG} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {FB} and {BH} (respectively).
And the angle {FAG} was shown (to be) equal to the angle {FBH}.
Thus, the base {FG} is equal to the base {FH} [Prop. 1.4].
And, again, since {GE} was shown (to be) equal to {EH}, and {EF} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {GE} and {EF} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {HE} and {EF} (respectively).
And the base {FG} (is) equal to the base {FH}.
Thus, the angle {GEF} is equal to the angle {HEF} [Prop. 1.8].
Each of the angles {GEF} and {HEF} (are) thus right-angles [Def. 1.10].
Thus, {FE} is at right-angles to {GH}, which was drawn at random through {E} (in the reference plane passing though {AB} and {AC}).
So, similarly, we can show that {FE} will make right-angles with all straight-lines joined to it which are in the reference plane.
And a straight-line is at right-angles to a plane when it makes right-angles with all straight-lines joined to it which are in the plane [Def. 11.3].
Thus, {FE} is at right-angles to the reference plane.
And the reference plane is that (passing) through the straight-lines {AB} and {CD}.
Thus, {FE} is at right-angles to the plane (passing) through {AB} and {CD}.

Thus, if a straight-line is set up at right-angles to two straight-lines cutting one another, at the common point of section, then it will also be at right-angles to the plane (passing) through them (both).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
