If there are two parallel straight-lines, and random points are taken on each of them, then the straight-line joining the two points is in the same plane as the parallel (straight-lines).

Let AB and CD be two parallel straight-lines, and let the random points E and F have been taken on each of them (respectively).
I say that the straight-line joining points E and F is in the same (reference) plane as the parallel (straight-lines).

For (if) not, and if possible, let it be in a more elevated (plane), such as EGF.
And let a plane have been drawn through EGF.
So it will make a straight cutting in the reference plane [Prop. 11.3].
Let it make EF.
Thus, two straight-lines (with the same end-points), EGF and EF, will enclose an area.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, the straight-line joining E to F is not in a more elevated plane.
The straight-line joining E to F is thus in the plane through the parallel (straight-lines) AB and CD.

Thus, if there are two parallel straight-lines, and random points are taken on each of them, then the straight-line joining the two points is in the same plane as the parallel (straight-lines).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
