To set up a straight-line at right-angles to a given plane from a given point in it.

Let the given plane be the reference (plane), and {A} a point in it.
So, it is required to set up a straight-line at right-angles to the reference plane at point {A}.

Let some raised point {B} have been assumed, and let the perpendicular (straight-line) {BC} have been drawn from {B} to the reference plane [Prop. 11.11].
And let {AD} have been drawn from point {A} parallel to {BC} [Prop. 1.31].

Therefore, since {AD} and {CB} are two parallel straight-lines, and one of them, {BC}, is at right-angles to the reference plane, the remaining (one) {AD} is thus also at right-angles to the reference plane [Prop. 11.8].

Thus, {AD} has been set up at right-angles to the given plane, from the point in it, {A}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
