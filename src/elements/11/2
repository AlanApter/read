If two straight-lines cut one another then they are in one plane, and every triangle (formed using segments of both lines) is in one plane.

For let the two straight-lines {AB} and {CD} have cut one another at point {E}.
I say that {AB} and {CD} are in one plane, and that every triangle (formed using segments of both lines) is in one plane.

For let the random points {F} and {G} have been taken on {EC} and {EB} (respectively).
And let {CB} and {FG} have been joined, and let {F} {H} and {GK} have been drawn across.
I say, first of all, that triangle {ECB} is in one (reference) plane.
For if part of triangle {ECB}, either {FHC} or {GBK}, is in the reference [plane], and the remainder in a different (plane) then a part of one the straight-lines {EC} and {EB} will also be in the reference plane, and (a part) in a different (plane).
And if the part {FCBG} of triangle {ECB} is in the reference plane, and the remainder in a different (plane) then parts of both of the straight-lines {EC} and {EB} will also be in the reference plane, and (parts) in a different (plane).
The very thing was shown to be absurb [Prop. 11.1].
Thus, triangle {ECB} is in one plane.
And in whichever (plane) triangle {ECB} is (found), in that (plane) {EC} and {EB} (will) each also (be found).
And in whichever (plane) {EC} and {EB} (are) each (found), in that (plane) {AB} and {CD} (will) also (be found) [Prop. 11.1].
Thus, the straight-lines {AB} and {CD} are in one plane, and every triangle (formed using segments of both lines) is in one plane.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
