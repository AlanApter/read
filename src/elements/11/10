If two straight-lines joined to one another are (respectively) parallel to two straight-lines joined to one another, (but are) not in the same plane, then they will contain equal angles.

For let the two straight-lines joined to one another, {AB line} and {BC line}, be (respectively) parallel to the two straight-lines joined to one another, {DE line} and {EF line}, (but) not in the same plane.
I say that angle {ABC angle} is equal to (angle) {DEF angle}.

For let {BA line}, {BC line}, {ED line}, and {EF line} have been cut off (so as to be, respectively) equal to one another.
And let {AD line}, {CF line}, {BE line}, {AC line}, and {DF line} have been joined.

And since {BA line} is equal and parallel to {ED line}, {AD line} is thus also equal and parallel to {BE line} [Prop. 1.33].
So, for the same reasons, {CF line} is also equal and parallel to {BE line}.
Thus, {AD line} and {CF line} are each equal and parallel to {BE line}.
And straight-lines parallel to the same straight-line, and which are not in the same plane as it, are also parallel to one another [Prop. 11.9].
Thus, {AD line} is parallel and equal to {CF line}.
And {AC line} and {DF line} join them.
Thus, {AC line} is also equal and parallel to {DF line} [Prop. 1.33].
And since the two (straight-lines) {AB line} and {BC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DE line} and {EF line} (respectvely), and the base {AC line} (is) equal to the base {DF line}, the angle {ABC angle} is thus equal to the (angle) {DEF angle} [Prop. 1.8].

Thus, if two straight-lines joined to one another are (respectively) parallel to two straight-lines joined to one another, (but are) not in the same plane, then they will contain equal angles.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
