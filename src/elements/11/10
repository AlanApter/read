If two straight-lines joined to one another are (respectively) parallel to two straight-lines joined to one another, (but are) not in the same plane, then they will contain equal angles.

For let the two straight-lines joined to one another, AB and BC, be (respectively) parallel to the two straight-lines joined to one another, DE and EF, (but) not in the same plane.
I say that angle ABC is equal to (angle) DEF.

For let BA, BC, ED, and EF have been cut off (so as to be, respectively) equal to one another.
And let AD, CF, BE, AC, and DF have been joined.

And since BA is equal and parallel to ED, AD is thus also equal and parallel to BE [Prop. 1.33].
So, for the same reasons, CF is also equal and parallel to BE.
Thus, AD and CF are each equal and parallel to BE.
And straight-lines parallel to the same straight-line, and which are not in the same plane as it, are also parallel to one another [Prop. 11.9].
Thus, AD is parallel and equal to CF.
And AC and DF join them.
Thus, AC is also equal and parallel to DF [Prop. 1.33].
And since the two (straight-lines) AB and BC are equal to the two (straight-lines) DE and EF (respectvely), and the base AC (is) equal to the base DF, the angle ABC is thus equal to the (angle) DEF [Prop. 1.8].

Thus, if two straight-lines joined to one another are (respectively) parallel to two straight-lines joined to one another, (but are) not in the same plane, then they will contain equal angles.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
