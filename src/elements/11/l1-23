And we can demonstrate, thusly, in which manner to take the (square) on OR equal to that (area) by which the (square) on AB is greater than the (square) on LO.
Let the straight-lines AB and LO be set out, and let AB be greater, and let the semicircle ABC have been drawn around it.
And let AC, equal to the straight-line LO, which is not greater than the diameter AB, have been inserted into the semicircle ABC [Prop. 4.1].
And let CB have been joined.
Therefore, since the angle ACB is in the semicircle ACB, ACB is thus a right-angle [Prop. 3.31].
Thus, the (square) on AB is equal to the (sum of the) squares on AC and CB [Prop. 1.47].
Hence, the (square) on AB is greater than the (square) on AC by the (square) on CB.
And AC (is) equal to LO.
Thus, the (square) on AB is greater than the (square) on LO by the (square) on CB.
Therefore, if we take OR equal to BC then the (square) on AB will be greater than the (square) on LO by the (square) on OR.
(Which is) the very thing it was prescribed to do.
