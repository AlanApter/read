If four straight-lines are proportional then the similar, and similarly described, parallelepiped solids on them will also be proportional.
And if the similar, and similarly described, parallelepiped solids on them are proportional then the straight-lines themselves will be proportional.

Let {AB}, {CD}, {EF}, and {GH}, be four proportional straight-lines, (such that) as {AB} (is) to {CD}, so {EF} (is) to {GH}.
And let the similar, and similarly laid out, parallelepiped solids {KA}, {LC}, {ME} and {NG} have been described on {AB}, {CD}, {EF}, and {GH} (respectively).
I say that as {KA} is to {LC}, so {ME} (is) to {NG}.

For since the parallelepiped solid {KA} is similar to {LC}, {KA} thus has to {LC} the cubed ratio that {AB} (has) to {CD} [Prop. 11.33].
So, for the same (reasons), {ME} also has to {NG} the cubed ratio that {EF} (has) to {GH} [Prop. 11.33].
And since as {AB} is to {CD}, so {EF} (is) to {GH}, thus, also, as {AK} (is) to {LC}, so {ME} (is) to {NG}.

And so let solid {AK} be to solid {LC}, as solid {ME} (is) to {NG}.
I say that as straight-line {AB} is to {CD}, so {EF} (is) to {GH}.

For, again, since {KA} has to {LC} the cubed ratio that {AB} (has) to {CD} [Prop. 11.33], and {ME} also has to {NG} the cubed ratio that {EF} (has) to {GH} [Prop. 11.33], and as {KA} is to {LC}, so {ME} (is) to {NG}, thus, also, as {AB} (is) to {CD}, so {EF} (is) to {GH}.
Thus, if four straight-lines are proportional, and so on of the proposition.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
