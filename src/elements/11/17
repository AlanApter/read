If two straight-lines are cut by parallel planes then they will be cut in the same ratios.

For let the two straight-lines {AB} and {CD} be cut by the parallel planes {GH}, {KL}, and {MN} at the points {A}, {E}, {B}, and {C}, {F}, {D} (respectively).
I say that as the straight-line {AE} is to {EB}, so {CF} (is) to {FD}.

For let {AC}, {BD}, and {AD} have been joined, and let {AD} meet the plane {KL} at point {O}, and let {EO} and {OF} have been joined.

And since two parallel planes {KL} and {MN} are cut by the plane {EBDO}, their common sections {EO} and {BD} are parallel [Prop. 11.16].
So, for the same (reasons), since two parallel planes {GH} and {KL} are cut by the plane {AOFC}, their common sections {AC} and {OF} are parallel [Prop. 11.16].
And since the straight-line {EO} has been drawn parallel to one of the sides {BD} of triangle {ABD}, thus, proportionally, as {AE} is to {EB}, so {AO} (is) to {OD} [Prop. 6.2].
Again, since the straight-line {OF} has been drawn parallel to one of the sides {AC} of triangle {ADC}, proportionally, as {AO} is to {OD}, so {CF} (is) to {FD} [Prop. 6.2].
And it was also shown that as {AO} (is) to {OD}, so {AE} (is) to {EB}.
And thus as {AE} (is) to {EB}, so {CF} (is) to {FD} [Prop. 5.11].

Thus, if two straight-lines are cut by parallel planes then they will be cut in the same ratios.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
