If a parallelipiped solid is cut by a plane which is parallel to the opposite planes (of the parallelipiped) then as the base (is) to the base, so the solid will be to the solid.

For let the parallelipiped solid {ABCD given} have been cut by the plane {FG polygon} which is parallel to the opposite planes {RA polygon} and {DH polygon}.
I say that as the base {AEFV polygon} (is) to the base {EHCF polygon}, so the solid {ABFU given} (is) to the solid {EGCD given}.

For let {AH line} have been produced in each direction.
And let any number whatsoever (of lengths), {AK line} and {KL line}, be made equal to {AE line}, and any number whatsoever (of lengths), {HM line} and {MN line}, equal to {EH line}.
And let the parallelograms {LP polygon}, {KV polygon}, {HW polygon}, and {MS polygon} have been completed, and the solids {LQ given}, {KR given}, {DM given}, and {MT given}.

And since the straight-lines {LK line}, {KA line}, and {AE line} are equal to one another, the parallelograms {LP polygon}, {KV polygon}, and {AF polygon} are also equal to one another, and {KO polygon}, {KB polygon}, and {AG polygon} (are equal) to one another, and, further, {LX polygon}, {KQ polygon}, and {AR polygon} (are equal) to one another.
For (they are) opposite [Prop. 11.24].
So, for the same (reasons), the parallelograms {EC polygon}, {HW polygon}, and {MS polygon} are also equal to one another, and {HG polygon}, {HI polygon}, and {IN polygon} are equal to one another, and, further, {DH polygon}, {MY polygon}, and {NT polygon} (are equal to one another).
Thus, three planes of (one of) the solids {LQ given}, {KR given}, and {AU given} are equal to the (corresponding) three planes (of the others).
But, the three planes (in one of the soilds) are equal to the three opposite planes [Prop. 11.24].
Thus, the three solids {LQ given}, {KR given}, and {AU given} are equal to one another [Def. 11.10].
So, for the same (reasons), the three solids {ED given}, {DM given}, and {MT given} are also equal to one another.
Thus, as many multiples as the base {LF polygon} is of the base {AF polygon}, so many multiples is the solid {LU given} also of the the solid {AU given}.
So, for the same (reasons), as many multiples as the base {NF polygon} is of the base {FH polygon}, so many multiples is the solid {NU given} also of the solid {HU given}.
And if the base {LF polygon} is equal to the base {NF polygon} then the solid {LU given} is also equal to the solid {NU given}.
And if the base {LF polygon} exceeds the base {NF polygon} then the solid {LU given} also exceeds the solid {NU given}.
And if ({LF polygon}) is less than ({NF polygon}) then ({LU given}) is (also) less than ({NU given}).
So, there are four magnitudes, the two bases {AF polygon} and {FH polygon}, and the two solids {AU given} and {UH given}, and equal multiples have been taken of the base {AF polygon} and the solid {AU given}---(namely), the base {LF polygon} and the solid {LU given}---and of the base {HF polygon} and the solid {HU given}---(namely), the base {NF polygon} and the solid {NU given}.
And it has been shown that if the base {LF polygon} exceeds the base {FN polygon} then the solid {LU given} also exceeds the [solid] {NU given}, and if ({LF polygon} is) equal (to {FN polygon}) then ({LU given} is) equal (to {NU given}), and if ({LF polygon} is) less than ({FN polygon}) then ({LU given} is) less than ({NU given}).
Thus, as the base {AF polygon} is to the base {FH polygon}, so the solid {AU given} (is) to the solid {UH given} [Def. 5.5].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
