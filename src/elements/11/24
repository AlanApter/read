If a solid (figure) is contained by (six) parallel planes then its opposite planes are both equal and parallelogrammic.

For let the solid (figure) {CDHG} have been contained by the parallel planes {AC}, {GF}, and {AH}, {DF}, and {BF}, {AE}.
I say that its opposite planes are both equal and parallelogrammic.

For since the two parallel planes {BG} and {CE} are cut by the plane {AC}, their common sections are parallel [Prop. 11.16].
Thus, {AB} is parallel to {DC}.
Again, since the two parallel planes {BF} and {AE} are cut by the plane {AC}, their common sections are parallel [Prop. 11.16].
Thus, {BC} is parallel to {AD}.
And {AB} was also shown (to be) parallel to {DC}.
Thus, {AC} is a parallelogram.
So, similarly, we can also show that {DF}, {FG}, {GB}, {BF}, and {AE} are each parallelograms.

Let {AH} and {DF} have been joined.
And since {AB} is parallel to {DC}, and {BH} to {CF}, so the two (straight-lines) joining one another, {AB} and {BH}, are parallel to the two straight-lines joining one another, {DC} and {CF} (respectively), not (being) in the same plane.
Thus, they will contain equal angles [Prop. 11.10].
Thus, angle {ABH} (is) equal to (angle) {DCF}.
And since the two (straight-lines) {AB} and {BH} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DC} and {CF} (respectively) [Prop. 1.34], and angle {ABH} is equal to angle {DCF}, the base {AH} is thus equal to the base {DF}, and triangle {ABH} is equal to triangle {DCF} [Prop. 1.4].
And parallelogram {BG} is double (triangle) {ABH}, and parallelogram {CE} double (triangle) {DCF} [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, parallelogram {BG} (is) equal to parallelogram {CE}.
So, similarly, we can show that {AC} is also equal to {GF}, and {AE} to {BF}.

Thus, if a solid (figure) is contained by (six) parallel planes then its opposite planes are both equal and parallelogrammic.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
