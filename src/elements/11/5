If a straight-line is set up at right-angles to three straight-lines cutting one another, at the common point of section, then the three straight-lines are in one plane.

For let some straight-line {AB} have been set up at right-angles to three straight-lines {BC}, {BD}, and {BE}, at the (common) point of section {B}.
I say that {BC}, {BD}, and {BE} are in one plane.

For (if) not, and if possible, let {BD} and {BE} be in the reference plane, and {BC} in a more elevated (plane).
And let the plane through {AB} and {BC} have been produced.
So it will make a straight-line as a common section with the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
Let it make {BF}.
Thus, the three straight-lines {AB}, {BC}, and {BF} are in one planeâ€”(namely), that drawn through {AB} and {BC}.
And since {AB} is at right-angles to each of {BD} and {BE}, {AB} is thus also at right-angles to the plane (passing) through {BD} and {BE} [Prop. 11.4].
And the plane (passing) through {BD} and {BE} is the reference plane.
Thus, {AB} is at right-angles to the reference plane.
Hence, {AB} will also make right-angles with all straight-lines joined to it which are also in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
And {BF}, which is in the reference plane, is joined to it.
Thus, the angle {ABF} is a right-angle.
And {ABC} was also assumed to be a right-angle.
Thus, angle {ABF} (is) equal to {ABC}.
And they are in one plane.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {BC} is not in a more elevated plane.
Thus, the three straight-lines {BC}, {BD}, and {BE} are in one plane.

Thus, if a straight-line is set up at right-angles to three straight-lines cutting one another, at the (common) point of section, then the three straight-lines are in one plane.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
