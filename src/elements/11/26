To construct a solid angle equal to a given solid angle on a given straight-line, and at a given point on it.

Let {AB} be the given straight-line, and {A} the given point on it, and {D} the given solid angle, contained by the plane angles {EDC}, {EDF}, and {FDC}.
So, it is necessary to construct a solid angle equal to the solid angle {D} on the straight-line {AB}, and at the point {A} on it.

For let some random point {F} have been taken on {DF}, and let {FG} have been drawn from {F} perpendicular to the plane through {ED} and {DC} [Prop. 11.11], and let it meet the plane at {G}, and let {DG} have been joined.
And let {BAL}, equal to the angle {EDC}, and {BAK}, equal to {EDG}, have been constructed on the straight-line {AB} at the point {A} on it [Prop. 1.23].
And let {AK} be made equal to {DG}.
And let {KH} have been set up at the point {K} at right-angles to the plane through {BAL} [Prop. 11.12].
And let {KH} be made equal to {GF}.
And let {HA} have been joined.
I say that the solid angle at {A}, contained by the (plane) angles {BAL}, {BAH}, and {HAL}, is equal to the solid angle at {D}, contained by the (plane) angles {EDC}, {EDF}, and {FDC}.

For let {AB} and {DE} have been cut off (so as to be) equal, and let {HB}, {KB}, {FE}, and {GE} have been joined.
And since {FG} is at right-angles to the reference plane ({EDC}), it will also make right-angles with all of the straight-lines joined to it which are also in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].
Thus, the angles {FGD} and {FGE} are right-angles.
So, for the same (reasons), the angles {HKA} and {HKB} are also right-angles.
And since the two (straight-lines) {KA} and {AB} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {GD} and {DE}, respectively, and they contain equal angles, the base {KB} is thus equal to the base {GE} [Prop. 1.4].
And {KH} is also equal to {GF}.
And they contain right-angles (with the respective bases).
Thus, {HB} (is) also equal to {FE} [Prop. 1.4].
Again, since the two (straight-lines) {AK} and {KH} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DG} and {GF} (respectively), and they contain right-angles, the base {AH} is thus equal to the base {FD} [Prop. 1.4].
And {AB} (is) also equal to {DE}.
So, the two (straight-lines) {HA} and {AB} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DF} and {DE} (respectively).
And the base {HB} (is) equal to the base {FE}.
Thus, the angle {BAH} is equal to the angle {EDF} [Prop. 1.8].
So, for the same (reasons), {HAL} is also equal to {FDC}.
And {BAL} is also equal to {EDC}.

Thus, (a solid angle) has been constructed, equal to the given solid angle at {D}, on the given straight-line {AB}, at the given point {A} on it.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
