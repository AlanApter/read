If two planes cut one another then their common section is a straight-line.

For let the two planes {AB} and {BC} cut one another, and let their common section be the line {DB}.
I say that the line {DB} is straight.

For, if not, let the straight-line {DEB} have been joined from {D} to {B} in the plane {AB}, and the straight-line {DF} {B} in the plane {BC}.
So two straight-lines, {DEB} and {DFB}, will have the same ends, and they will clearly enclose an area.
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, {DEB} and {DFB} are not straight-lines.
So, similarly, we can show than no other straight-line can be joined from {D} to {B} except {DB}, the common section of the planes {AB} and {BC}.

Thus, if two planes cut one another then their common section is a straight-line.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
