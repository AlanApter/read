Parallelepiped solids which are on the same base, and (have) the same height, and in which the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up are not on the same straight-lines, are equal to one another.

Let the parallelepiped solids {CM} and {CN} be on the same base, {AB}, and (have) the same height, and let the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {AF}, {AG}, {LM}, {LN}, {CD}, {CE}, {BH}, and {BK}, not be on the same straight-lines.
I say that the solid {CM} is equal to the solid {CN}.

For let {NK} and {DH} have been produced, and let them have joined one another at {R}.
And, further, let {FM} and {GE} have been produced to {P} and {Q} (respectively).
And let {AO}, {LP}, {CQ}, and {BR} have been joined.
So, solid {CM}, whose base (is) parallelogram {ACBL}, and opposite (face) {FDHM}, is equal to solid {CP}, whose base (is) parallelogram {ACBL}, and opposite (face) {OQRP}.
For they are on the same base, {ACBL}, and (have) the same height, and the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {AF}, {AO}, {LM}, {LP}, {CD}, {CQ}, {BH}, and {BR}, are on the same straight-lines, {FP} and {DR} [Prop. 11.29].
But, solid {CP}, whose base is parallelogram {ACBL}, and opposite (face) {OQRP}, is equal to solid {CN}, whose base (is) parallelogram {ACBL}, and opposite (face) {GEKN}.
For, again, they are on the same base, {ACBL}, and (have) the same height, and the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up in them, {AG}, {AO}, {CE}, {CQ}, {LN}, {LP}, {BK}, and {BR}, are on the same straight-lines, {GQ} and {NR} [Prop. 11.29].
Hence, solid {CM} is also equal to solid {CN}.

Thus, parallelepiped solids (which are) on the same base, and (have) the same height, and in which the (ends of the straight-lines) standing up are not on the same straight-lines, are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
