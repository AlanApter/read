If two straight-lines are at right-angles to the same plane then the straight-lines will be parallel.

For let the two straight-lines {AB} and {CD} be at right-angles to a reference plane.
I say that {AB} is parallel to {CD}.

For let them meet the reference plane at points {B} and {D} (respectively). And let the straight-line {BD} have been joined.
And let {DE} have been drawn at right-angles to {BD} in the reference plane.
And let {DE} be made equal to {AB}.
And let {BE}, {AE}, and {AD} have been joined.

And since {AB} is at right-angles to the reference plane, it will [thus] also make right-angles with all straight-lines joined to it which are in the reference plane [Def. 11.3].

And {BD} and {BE}, which are in the reference plane, are each joined to {AB}.
Thus, each of the angles {ABD} and {ABE} are right-angles.
So, for the same (reasons), each of the angles {CDB} and {CDE} are also right-angles.
And since {AB} is equal to {DE}, and {BD} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AB} and {BD} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {ED} and {DB} (respectively).
And they contain right-angles.
Thus, the base {AD} is equal to the base {BE} [Prop. 1.4].
And since {AB} is equal to {DE}, and {AD} (is) also (equal) to {BE}, the two (straight-lines) {AB} and {BE} are thus equal to the two (straight-lines) {ED} and {DA} (respectively).
And their base {AE} (is) common.
Thus, angle {ABE} is equal to angle {EDA} [Prop. 1.8].
And {ABE} (is) a right-angle.
Thus, {EDA} (is) also a right-angle.
{ED} is thus at right-angles to {DA}.
And it is also at right-angles to each of {BD} and {DC}.
Thus, {ED} is standing at right-angles to the three straight-lines {BD}, {DA}, and {DC} at the (common) point of section.
Thus, the three straight-lines {BD}, {DA}, and {DC} are in one plane [Prop. 11.5].
And in which(ever) plane {DB} and {DA} (are found), in that (plane) {AB} (will) also (be found).
For every triangle is in one plane [Prop. 11.2].
And each of the angles {ABD} and {BDC} is a right-angle.
Thus, {AB} is parallel to {CD} [Prop. 1.28].

Thus, if two straight-lines are at right-angles to the same plane then the straight-lines will be parallel.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
