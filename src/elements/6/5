If two triangles have proportional sides then the triangles will be equiangular, and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be two triangles having proportional sides, (so that) as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so {DE line} (is) to {EF line}, and as {BC line} (is) to {CA line}, so {EF line} (is) to {FD line}, and, further, as {BA line} (is) to {AC line}, so {ED line} (is) to {DF line}.
I say that triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to triangle {DEF polygon}, and (that the triangles) will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal.
(That is), (angle) {ABC angle} (equal) to {DEF angle}, {BCA angle} to {EFD angle}, and, further, {BAC angle} to {EDF angle}.

For let (angle) {FEG angle}, equal to angle {ABC angle}, and (angle) {EFG angle}, equal to {ACB angle}, have been constructed on the straight-line {EF line} at the points {E point} and {F point} on it (respectively) [Prop. 1.23].
Thus, the remaining (angle) at {A point} is equal to the remaining (angle) at {G point} [Prop. 1.32].

Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to [triangle] {EGF polygon}.
Thus, for triangles {ABC polygon} and {EGF polygon}, the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and (those) sides subtending equal angles correspond [Prop. 6.4].
Thus, as {AB line} is to {BC line}, [so] {GE line} (is) to {EF line}.
But, as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so, it was assumed, (is) {DE line} to {EF line}.
Thus, as {DE line} (is) to {EF line}, so {GE line} (is) to {EF line} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, {DE line} and {GE line} each have the same ratio to {EF line}.
Thus, {DE line} is equal to {GE line} [Prop. 5.9].
So, for the same (reasons), {DF line} is also equal to {GF line}.
Therefore, since {DE line} is equal to {EG line}, and {EF line} (is) common, the two (sides) {DE line}, {EF line} are equal to the two (sides) {GE line}, {EF line} (respectively).
And base {DF line} [is] equal to base {FG line}.
Thus, angle {DEF angle} is equal to angle {GEF angle} [Prop. 1.8], and triangle {DEF angle} (is) equal to triangle {GEF angle}, and the remaining angles (are) equal to the remaining angles which the equal sides subtend [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, angle {DFE angle} is also equal to {GFE angle}, and (angle) {EDF angle} to {EGF angle}.
And since (angle) {FED angle} is equal to {GEF angle}, and (angle) {GEF angle} to {ABC angle}, angle {ABC angle} is thus also equal to {DEF angle}.
So, for the same (reasons), (angle) {ACB angle} is also equal to {DFE angle}, and, further, the (angle) at {A point} to the (angle) at {D point}.
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to triangle {DEF polygon}.

Thus, if two triangles have proportional sides then the triangles will be equiangular, and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
