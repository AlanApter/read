(Rectilinear figures) similar to the same rectilinear figure are also similar to one another.

Let each of the rectilinear figures {A given} and {B given} be similar to (the rectilinear figure) {C given}.
I say that {A given} is also similar to {B given}.

For since {A given} is similar to {C given}, ({A given}) is equiangular to ({C given}), and has the sides about the equal angles proportional [Def. 6.1].
Again, since {B given} is similar to {C given}, ({B given}) is equiangular to ({C given}), and has the sides about the equal angles proportional [Def. 6.1].
Thus, {A given} and {B given} are each equiangular to {C given}, and have the sides about the equal angles proportional.
Thus, {A given} is similar to {B given} [Def. 6.1].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
