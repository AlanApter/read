If two numbers are both prime to each of two numbers then the (numbers) created from (multiplying) them will also be prime to one another.

For let two numbers, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, both be prime to each of two numbers, {C magnitude} and {D magnitude}.
And let {A magnitude} make {E magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, and let {C magnitude} make {F magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
I say that {E magnitude} and {F magnitude} are prime to one another.

For since {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are each prime to {C magnitude}, the (number) created from (multiplying) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} will thus also be prime to {C magnitude} [Prop. 7.24].
And {E magnitude} is the (number) created from (multiplying) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} and {C magnitude} are prime to one another.
So, for the same (reasons), {E magnitude} and {D magnitude} are also prime to one another.
Thus, {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} are each prime to {E magnitude}.
Thus, the (number) created from (multiplying) {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} will also be prime to {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.24].
And {F magnitude} is the (number) created from (multiplying) {C magnitude} and {D magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} and {F magnitude} are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
