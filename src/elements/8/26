Similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to a(nother) square number.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be similar plane numbers.
I say that {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to a(nother) square number.

For since {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar plane numbers, one number thus falls (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.18].
Let it (so) fall, and let it be {C magnitude}.
And let the least numbers, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {B magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 8.2].
The outermost of them, {D magnitude} and {F magnitude}, are thus square [Prop. 8.2 corr.].
And since as {D magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, and {D magnitude} and {F magnitude} are square, {A magnitude} thus has to {B magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to a(nother) square number.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
