If the square on a straight-line is five times the (square) on a piece of it, and double the aforementioned piece is cut in extreme and mean ratio, then the greater piece is the remaining part of the original straight-line.

For let the square on the straight-line {AB} be five times the (square) on the piece of it, {AC}.
And let {CD} be double {AC}.
{I} say that if {CD} is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the greater piece is {CB}.

For let the squares {AF} and {CG} have been described on each of {AB} and {CD} (respectively).
And let the figure in {AF} have been drawn.
And let {BE} have been drawn across.
And since the (square) on {BA} is five times the (square) on {AC}, {AF} is five times {AH}.
Thus, gnomon {MNO} (is) four times {AH}.
And since {DC} is double {CA}, the (square) on {DC} is thus four times the (square) on {CA}â€”that is to say, {CG} (is four times) {AH}.
And the gnomon {MNO} was also shown (to be) four times {AH}.
Thus, gnomon {MNO} (is) equal to {CG}.
And since {DC} is double {CA}, and {DC} (is) equal to {CK}, and {AC} to {CH}, [{KC} (is) thus also double {CH}], (and) {KB} (is) also double {BH} [Prop. 6.1].
And {LH} plus {HB} is also double {HB} [Prop. 1.43].
Thus, {KB} (is) equal to {LH} plus {HB}.
And the whole gnomon {MNO} was also shown (to be) equal to the whole of {CG}.
Thus, the remainder {HF} is also equal to (the remainder) {BG}.
And {BG} is the (rectangle contained) by {CDB}.
For {CD} (is) equal to {DG}.
And {HF} (is) the square on {CB}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {CDB} is equal to the (square) on {CB}.
Thus, as {DC} is to {CB}, so {CB} (is) to {BD} [Prop. 6.17].
And {DC} (is) greater than {CB} (see lemma).
Thus, {CB} (is) also greater than {BD} [Prop. 5.14].
Thus, if the straight-line {CD} is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the greater piece is {CB}.

Thus, if the square on a straight-line is five times the (square) on a piece of itself, and double the aforementioned piece is cut in extreme and mean ratio, then the greater piece is the remaining part of the original straight-line. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Lemma

And it can be shown that double {AC} (i.e., {DC}) is greater than {BC}, as follows.

For if (double {AC} is) not (greater than {BC}), if possible, let {BC} be double {CA}.
Thus, the (square) on {BC} (is) four times the (square) on {CA}.
Thus, the (sum of) the (squares) on {BC} and {CA} (is) five times the (square) on {CA}.
And the (square) on {BA} was assumed (to be) five times the (square) on {CA}.
Thus, the (square) on {BA} is equal to the (sum of) the (squares) on {BC} and {CA}.
The very thing (is) impossible [Prop. 2.4].
Thus, {CB} is not double {AC}.
So, similarly, we can show that a (straight-line) less than {CB} is not double {AC} either.
For (in this case) the absurdity is much [greater].

Thus, double {AC} is greater than {CB}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
