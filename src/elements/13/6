If a rational straight-line is cut in extreme and mean ratio then each of the pieces is that irrational (straight-line) called an apotome.

Let {AB magnitude} be a rational straight-line cut in extreme and mean ratio at {C point}, and let {AC magnitude} be the greater piece.
I say that {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is each that irrational (straight-line) called an apotome.

For let {BA magnitude} have been produced, and let {AD magnitude} be made (equal) to half of {BA magnitude}.
Therefore, since the straight-line {AB magnitude} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {C point}, and {AD magnitude}, which is half of {AB magnitude}, has been added to the greater piece {AC magnitude}, the (square) on {CD magnitude} is thus five times the (square) on {DA magnitude} [Prop. 13.1].
Thus, the (square) on {CD magnitude} has to the (square) on {DA magnitude} the ratio which a number (has) to a number.
The (square) on {CD magnitude} (is) thus commensurable with the (square) on {DA magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And the (square) on {DA magnitude} (is) rational.
For {DA magnitude} [is] rational, being half of {AB magnitude}, which is rational.
Thus, the (square) on {CD magnitude} (is) also rational [Def. 10.4].
Thus, {CD magnitude} is also rational.
And since the (square) on {CD magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {DA magnitude} the ratio which a square number (has) to a square number, {CD magnitude} (is) thus incommensurable in length with {DA magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, {CD magnitude} and {DA magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {AC magnitude} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
Again, since {AB magnitude} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and {AC magnitude} is the greater piece, the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is thus equal to the (square) on {AC magnitude} [Def. 6.3, Prop. 6.17].
Thus, the (square) on the apotome {AC magnitude}, applied to the rational (straight-line) {AB magnitude}, makes {BC magnitude} as width.
And the (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), makes a first apotome as width [Prop. 10.97].
Thus, {CB magnitude} is a first apotome.
And {CA magnitude} was also shown (to be) an apotome.

Thus, if a rational straight-line is cut in extreme and mean ratio then each of the pieces is that irrational (straight-line) called an apotome.
