If an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle which has a rational diameter then the side of the pentagon is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.

For let the equilateral pentagon {ABCDE} have been inscribed in the circle {ABCDE} which has a rational diameter.
I say that the side of pentagon [{ABCDE}] is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.

For let the center of the circle, point {F}, have been found [Prop. 3.1].
And let {AF} and {FB} have been joined.
And let them have been drawn across to points {G} and {H} (respectively).
And let {AC} have been joined.
And let {FK} made (equal) to the fourth part of {AF}.
And {AF} (is) rational.
{FK} (is) thus also rational.
And {BF} is also rational.
Thus, the whole of {BK} is rational.
And since circumference {ACG} is equal to circumference {ADG}, of which {ABC} is equal to {AED}, the remainder {CG} is thus equal to the remainder {GD}.
And if we join {AD} then the angles at {L} are inferred (to be) right-angles, and {CD} (is inferred to be) double {CL} [Prop. 1.4].
So, for the same (reasons), the (angles) at {M} are also right-angles, and {AC} (is) double {CM}.
Therefore, since angle {ALC} (is) equal to {AMF}, and (angle) {LAC} (is) common to the two triangles {ACL} and {AMF}, the remaining (angle) {ACL} is thus equal to the remaining (angle) {MFA} [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, triangle {ACL} is equiangular to triangle {AMF}.
Thus, proportionally, as {LC} (is) to {CA}, so {MF} (is) to {FA} [Prop. 6.4].
And (we can take) the doubles of the leading (magnitudes).
Thus, as double {LC} (is) to {CA}, so double {MF} (is) to {FA}.
And as double {MF} (is) to {FA}, so {MF} (is) to half of {FA}.
And,thus,asdoubleLC(is)toCA,soMF(is)to half of {FA}.
And (we can take) the halves of the following (magnitudes).
Thus, as double {LC} (is) to half of {CA}, so {MF} (is) to the fourth of {FA}.
And {DC} is double {LC}, and {CM} half of {CA}, and {FK} the fourth part of {FA}.
Thus, as {DC} is to {CM}, so {MF} (is) to {FK}.
Via composition, as the sum of {DCM} (i.e., {DC} and {CM}) (is) to {CM}, so {MK} (is) to {KF} [Prop. 5.18].
And, thus, as the (square) on the sum of {DCM} (is) to the (square) on {CM}, so the (square) on {MK} (is) to the (square) on {KF}.
And since the greater piece of a (straight-line) subtending two sides of a pentagon, such as {AC}, (which is) cut in extreme and mean ratio is equal to the side of the pentagon [Prop. 13.8]— thatistosay,toDC—-andthesquareonthegreaterpiece added to half of the whole is five times the (square) on half of the whole [Prop. 13.1], and {CM} (is) half of the whole, {AC}, thus the (square) on {DCM}, (taken) as one, is five times the (square) on {CM}.
And the (square) on {DCM}, (taken) as one, (is) to the (square) on {CM}, so the (square) on {MK} was shown (to be) to the (square) on {KF}.
Thus, the (square) on {MK} (is) five times the (square) on {KF}.
And the square on {KF} (is) rational.
For the diameter (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {MK} (is) also rational.
Thus, {MK} is rational [in square only].
And since {BF} is four times {FK}, {BK} is thus five times {KF}.
Thus, the (square) on {BK} (is) twenty-five times the (square) on {KF}.
And the (square) on {MK} (is) five times the square on {KF}.
Thus, the (square) on {BK} (is) five times the (square) on {KM}.
Thus, the (square) on {BK} does not have to the (square) on {KM} the ratio which a square number (has) to a square number.
Thus, {BK} is incommensurable in length with {KM} [Prop. 10.9].
And each of them is a rational (straight-line).
Thus, {BK} and {KM} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And if from a rational (straight-line) a rational (straight-line) is subtracted, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, then the remainder is that irrational (straight-line called) an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
Thus, {MB} is an apotome, and {MK} its attachment.
So, I say that (it is) also a fourth (apotome).
So, let the (square) on {N} be (made) equal to that (magnitude) by which the (square) on {BK} is greater than the (square) on {KM}.
Thus, the square on {BK} is greater than the (square) on {KM} by the (square) on {N}.
And since {KF} is commensurable (in length) with {FB} then, via composition, {KB} is also commensurable (in length) with {FB} [Prop. 10.15].
But, {BF} is commensurable (in length) with {BH}.
Thus, {BK} is also commensurable (in length) with {BH} [Prop. 10.12].
And since the (square) on {BK} is five times the (square) on {KM}, the (square) on {BK} thus has to the (square) on {KM} the ratio which 5 (has) to one.
Thus, via conversion, the (square) on {BK} has to the (square) on {N} the ratio which 5 (has) to 4 [Prop. 5.19 corr.], which is not (that) of a square (number) to a square (number).
{BK} is thus incommensurable (in length) with {N} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, the square on {BK} is greater than the (square) on {KM} by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({BK}).
Therefore, since the square on the whole, {BK}, is greater than the (square) on the attachment, {KM}, by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({BK}), and the whole, {BK}, is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {BH}, {MB} is thus a fourth apotome [Def. 10.14].
And the rectangle contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth apotome is irrational, and its square-root is that irrational (straight-line) called minor [Prop. 10.94].
And the square on {AB} is the rectangle contained by {HBM}, on account of joining {AH}, (so that) triangle {ABH} becomes equiangular with triangle {ABM} [Prop. 6.8], and (proportionally) as {HB} is to {BA}, so {AB} (is) to {BM}.

Thus, the side {AB} of the pentagon is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
