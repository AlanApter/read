If the side of a hexagon and of a decagon inscribed in the same circle are added together then the whole straight-line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio (at the junction point), and its greater piece is the side of the hexagon.

Let {ABC circle E} be a circle.
And of the figures inscribed in circle {ABC circle E}, let {BC line} be the side of a decagon, and {CD line} (the side) of a hexagon.
And let them be (laid down) straight-on (to one another).
I say that the whole straight-line {BD line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio (at {C point}), and that {CD line} is its greater piece.

For let the center of the circle, point {E point}, have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let {EB line}, {EC line}, and {ED line} have been joined, and let {BE line} have been drawn across to {A line}.
Since {BC line} is a side on an equilateral decagon, circumference {ACB arc E} (is) thus five times circumference {BC arcc E}.
Thus, circumference {AC arc E} (is) four times {CB arc E}.
And as circumference {AC arc E} (is) to {CB arc E}, so angle {AEC angle} (is) to {CEB angle} [Prop. 6.33].
Thus, (angle) {AEC angle} (is) four times {CEB angle}.
And since angle {EBC angle} (is) equal to {ECB angle} [Prop. 1.5], angle {AEC angle} is thus double {ECB angle} [Prop. 1.32].
And since straight-line {EC line} is equal to {CD line}—for each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon [inscribed] in circle {ABC circle E} [Prop. 4.15 corr.]— angle {CED angle} is also equal to angle {CDE angle} [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, angle {ECB angle} (is) double {EDC angle} [Prop. 1.32].
But, {AEC angle} was shown (to be) double {ECB angle}.
Thus, {AEC angle} (is) four times {EDC angle}.
And {AEC angle} was also shown (to be) four times {BEC angle}.
Thus, {EDC angle} (is) equal to {BEC angle}.
And angle {EBD angle} (is) common to the two triangles {BEC polygon} and {BED polygon}.
Thus, the remaining (angle) {BED angle} is equal to the (remaining angle) {ECB angle} [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, triangle {EBD polygon} is equiangular to triangle {EBC polygon}.
Thus, proportionally, as {DB line} is to {BE line}, so {EB line} (is) to {BC line} [Prop. 6.4].
And {EB line} (is) equal to {CD line}.
Thus, as {BD line} is to {DC line}, so {DC line} (is) to {CB line}.
And {BD line} (is) greater than {DC line}.
Thus, {DC line} (is) also greater than {CB line} [Prop. 5.14].
Thus, the straight-line {BD line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio [at {C point}], and {DC line} is its greater piece.
(Which is), the very thing it was required to show.
