To construct an icosahedron, and to enclose (it) in a sphere, like the aforementioned figures, and to show that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.

Let the diameter {AB line} of the given sphere be laid out, and let it have been cut at {C point} such that {AC line} is four times {CB line} [Prop. 6.10].
And let the semi-circle {ADB arc o} have been drawn on {AB line}.
And let the straight-line {CD line} have been drawn from {C point} at right-angles to {AB line}.
And let {DB line} have been joined.
And let the circle {EFGHK given} be set down, and let its radius be equal to {DB line}.
And let the equilateral and equiangular pentagon {EFGHK polygon} have been inscribed in circle {EFGHK given} [Prop. 4.11].
And let the circumferences {EF given}, {FG given}, {GH given}, {HK given}, and {KE given} have been cut in half at points {L point}, {M point}, {N point}, {O point}, and {P point} (respectively).
And let {LM line}, {MN line}, {NO line}, {OP line}, {PL line}, and {EP line} have been joined.
Thus, pentagon {LMNOP polygon} is also equilateral, and {EP line} (is) the side of the decagon (inscribed in the circle).
And let the straight-lines {EQ line}, {FR line}, {GS line}, {HT line}, and {KU line}, which are equal to the radius of circle {EFGHK given}, have been set up at right-angles to the plane of the circle, at points {E point}, {F point}, {G point}, {H point}, and {K point} (respectively).
And let {QR line}, {RS line}, {ST line}, {TU line}, {UQ line}, {QL line}, {LR line}, {RM line}, {MS line}, {SN line}, {NT line}, {TO line}, {OU line}, {UP line}, and {PQ line} have been joined.

And since {EQ line} and {KU line} are each at right-angles to the same plane, {EQ line} is thus parallel to {KU line} [Prop. 11.6].
And it is also equal to it.
And straight-lines joining equal and parallel (straight-lines) on the same side are (themselves) equal and parallel [Prop. 1.33].
Thus, {QU line} is equal and parallel to {EK line}.
And {EK line} (is the side) of an equilateral pentagon (inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}).
Thus, {QU line} (is) also the side of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}.
So, for the same (reasons), {QR line}, {RS line}, {ST line}, and {TU line} are also the sides of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}.
Pentagon {QRSTU polygon} (is) thus equilateral.
And side {QE line} is (the side) of a hexagon (inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}), and {EP line} (the side) of a decagon, and (angle) {QEP angle} is a right-angle, thus {QP line} is (the side) of a pentagon (inscribed in the same circle).
For the square on the side of a pentagon is (equal to the sum of) the (squares) on (the sides of) a hexagon and a decagon inscribed in the same circle [Prop. 13.10].
So, for the same (reasons), {PU line} is also the side of a pentagon.
And {QU line} is also (the side) of a pentagon.
Thus, triangle {QPU polygon} is equilateral.
So, for the same (reasons), (triangles) {QLR polygon}, {RMS polygon}, {SNT polygon}, and {TOU polygon} are each also equilateral.
And since {QL line} and {QP line} were each shown (to be the sides) of a pentagon, and {LP line} is also (the side) of a pentagon, triangle {QLP polygon} is thus equilateral.
So, for the same (reasons), triangles {LRM polygon}, {MSN polygon}, {NTO polygon}, and {OUP polygon} are each also equilateral.

Let the center, point {V point}, of circle {EFGHK given} have been found [Prop. 3.1].
And let {VZ line} have been set up, at (point) {V point}, at right-angles to the plane of the circle.
And let it have been produced on the other side (of the circle), like {VX line}.
And let {VW line} have been cut off (from {XZ line} so as to be equal to the side) of a hexagon, and each of {VX line} and {WZ line} (so as to be equal to the side) of a decagon.
And let {QZ line}, {QW line}, {UZ line}, {EV line}, {LV line}, {LX line}, and {XM line} havebeen joined.

And since {VW line} and {QE line} are each at right-angles to the plane of the circle, {VW line} is thus parallel to {QE line} [Prop. 11.6].
And they are also equal.
{EV line} and {QW line} are thus equal and parallel (to one another) [Prop. 1.33].
And {EV line} (is the side) of a hexagon.
Thus, {QW line} (is) also (the side) of a hexagon.
And since {QW line} is (the side) of a hexagon, and {WZ line} (the side) of a decagon, and angle {QWZ angle} is a right-angle [Def. 11.3, Prop. 1.29], {QZ line} is thus (the side) of a pentagon [Prop. 13.10].
So, for the same (reasons), {UZ line} is also (the side) of a pentagonâ€”inasmuch as, if we join {VK line} and {WU line} then they will be equal and opposite.
And {VK line}, being (equal) to the radius (of the circle), is (the side) of a hexagon [Prop. 4.15 corr.].
Thus, {WU line} (is) also the side of a hexagon.
And {WZ line} (is the side) of a decagon, and (angle) {UWZ angle} (is) a right-angle.
Thus, {UZ line} (is the side) of a pentagon [Prop. 13.10].
And {QU line} is also (the side) of a pentagon.
Triangle {QUZ polygon} is thus equilateral.
So, for the same (reasons), each of the remaining triangles, whose bases are the straight-lines {QR line}, {RS line}, {ST line}, and {TU line}, and apexes the point {Z point}, are also equilateral.
Again, since {VL line} (is the side) of a hexagon, and {VX line} (the side) of a decagon, and angle {LVX angle} is a right-angle, {LX line} is thus (the side) of a pentagon [Prop. 13.10].
So, for the same (reasons), if we join {MV line} , which is (the side) of a hexagon, {MX line} is also inferred (to be the side) of a pentagon.
And {LM line} is also (the side) of a pentagon.
Thus, triangle {LMX polygon} is equilateral.
So, similarly, it can be shown that each of the remaining triangles, whose bases are the (straight-lines) {MN line} , {NO line}, {OP line}, and {PL line}, and apexes the point {X point}, are also equilateral.
Thus, an icosahedron contained by twenty equilateral triangles has been constructed.

So, it is also necessary to enclose it in the given sphere, and to show that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.

For, since {VW line} is (the side) of a hexagon, and {WZ line} (the side) of a decagon, {VZ line} has thus been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {W point} , and {VW line} is its greater piece [Prop. 13.9].
Thus, as {ZV line} is to {VW line}, so {VW line} (is) to {WZ line}.
And {VW line} (is) equal to {VE line}, and {WZ line} to {VX line}.
Thus, as {ZV line} is to {VE line}, so {EV line} (is) to {VX line}.
And angles {ZVE angle} and {EVX angle} are right-angles.
Thus, if we join straight-line {EZ line} then angle {XEZ angle} will be a right-angle, on account of the similarity of triangles {XEZ polygon} and {VEZ polygon} [Prop. 6.8].
So, for the same (reasons), since as {ZV line} is to {VW line}, so {VW line} (is) to {WZ line}, and {ZV line} (is) equal to {XW line}, and {VW line} to {WQ line}, thus as {XW line} is to {WQ line}, so {QW line} (is) to {WZ line}.
And, again, on account of this, if we join {QX line} then the angle at {Q point} will be a right-angle [Prop. 6.8].
Thus, the semi-circle drawn on {XZ line} will also pass through {Q point} [Prop. 3.31].
And if {XZ line} remains fixed, and the semi-circle is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, then it will also pass through (point) {Q point}, and (through) the remaining (angular) points of the icosahedron.
And the icosahedron will have been enclosed by a sphere.
So, I say that (it is) also (enclosed) by the given (sphere).
For let {VW line} have been cut in half at {a point}.
And since the straight-line {VZ line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {W point}, and {ZW line} is its lesser piece, then the square on {ZW line} added to half of the greater piece, {Wa line}, is five times the (square) on half of the greater piece [Prop. 13.3].
Thus, the (square) on {Za line} is five times the (square) on {aW line}.
And {ZX line} is double {Za line}, and {VW line} double {aW line}.
Thus, the (square) on {ZX line} is five times the (square) on {WV line}.
And since {AC line} is four times {CB line}, {AB line} is thus five times {BC line}.
And as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AB line} (is) to the (square) on {BD line} [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9].
Thus, the (square) on {AB line} is five times the (square) on {BD line}.
And the (square) on {ZX line} was also shown (to be) five times the (square) on {VW line}.
And {DB line} is equal to {VW line}.
For each of them is equal to the radius of circle {EFGHK given}.
Thus, {AB line} (is) also equal to {XZ line}.
And {AB line} is the diameter of the given sphere.
Thus, {XZ line} is equal to the diameter of the given sphere.
Thus, the icosahedron has been enclosed by the given sphere.

So, I say that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.
For since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is five times the (square) on the radius of circle {EFGHK given}, the radius of circle {EFGHK given} is thus also rational.
Hence, its diameter is also rational.
And if an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle having a rational diameter then the side of the pentagon is that irrational (straight-line) called minor [Prop. 13.11].
And the side of pentagon {EFGHK polygon} is (the side) of the icosahedron.
Thus, the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.

Corollary

So, (it is) clear, from this, that the square on the diameter of the sphere is five times the square on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described, and that the the diameter of the sphere is the sum of (the side) of the hexagon, and two of (the sides) of the decagon, inscribed in the same circle.
