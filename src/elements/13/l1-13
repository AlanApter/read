It must be shown that as AB is to BC, so the (square) on AD (is) to the (square) on DC.

For, let the figure of the semi-circle have been set out, and let DB have been joined.
And let the square EC have been described on AC.
And let the parallelogram FB have been completed.
Therefore, since, on account of triangle DAB being equiangular to triangle DAC [Props. 6.8, 6.4], (proportionally) as BA is to AD, so DA (is) to AC, the (rectangle contained) by BA and AC is thus equal to the (square) on AD [Prop. 6.17].
And since as AB is to BC, so EB (is) to BF [Prop. 6.1].
And EB is the (rectangle contained) by BA and ACâ€”for EA (is) equal to AC.
And BF the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB.
Thus, as AB (is) to BC, so the (rectangle contained) by BA and AC (is) to the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB.
And the (rectangle contained) by BA and AC is equal to the (square) on AD, and the (rectangle contained) by ACB (is) equal to the (square) on DC.
For the perpendicular DC is the mean proportional to the pieces of the base, AC and CB, on account of ADB being a right-angle [Prop. 6.8 corr.].
Thus, as AB (is) to BC, so the (square) on AD (is) to the (square) on DC.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
