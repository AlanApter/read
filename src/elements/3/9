If some point is taken inside a circle, and more than two equal straight-lines radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, then the point taken is the center of the circle.

Let {ABC circle D} be a circle, and {D point} a point inside it, and let more than two equal straight-lines, {DA line}, {DB line}, and {DC line}, radiate from {D point} towards (the circumference of) circle {ABC circle D}.
I say that point {D point} is the center of circle {ABC circle D}.

For let {AB line} and {BC line} have been joined, and (then) have been cut in half at points {E point} and {F point} (respectively) [Prop. 1.10].
And {ED line} and {FD line} being joined, let them have been drawn through to points {G point}, {K point}, {H point}, and {L point} (as {EG line}, {DK line}, {FH line} and {DL line}, respectively).

Therefore, since {AE line} is equal to {EB line}, and {ED line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AE line}, {ED line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BE line}, {ED line} (respectively).
And the base {DA line} (is) equal to the base {DB line}.
Thus, angle {AED angle} is equal to angle {BED angle} [Prop. 1.8].
Thus, angles {AED angle} and {BED angle} (are) each right-angles [Def. 1.10].
Thus, {GK line} cuts {AB line} in half, and at right-angles.
And since, if some straight-line in a circle cuts some (other) straight-line in half, and at right-angles, then the center of the circle is on the former (straight-line) [Prop. 3.1 corr.], the center of the circle is thus on {GK line}.
So, for the same (reasons), the center of circle {ABC circle D} is also on {HL line}.
And the straight-lines {GK line} and {HL line} have no common (point) other than point {D point}.
Thus, point {D point} is the center of circle {ABC circle D}.

Thus, if some point is taken inside a circle, and more than two equal straight-lines radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, then the point taken is the center of the circle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
