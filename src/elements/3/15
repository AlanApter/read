In a circle, a diameter (is) the greatest (straight-line), and for the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the center is always greater than one further away.

Let {ABCD circle E} be a circle, and let {AD line} be its diameter, and {E point} (its) center.
And let {BC line} be nearer to the diameter {AD line}, and {FG line} further away.
I say that {AD line} is the greatest (straight-line), and {BC line} (is) greater than {FG line}.

For let {EH line} and {EK line} have been drawn from the center {E point}, at right-angles to {BC line} and {FG line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.12].
And since {BC line} is nearer to the center, and {FG line} further away, {EK line} (is) thus greater than {EH line} [Def. 3.5].
Let {EL line} be made equal to {EH line} [Prop. 1.3].
And {LM line} being drawn through {L point}, at right-angles to {EK line} [Prop. 1.11], let it have been drawn through to {N point} (as {MN line}).
And let {ME line}, {EN line}, {FE line}, and {EG line} have been joined.

And since {EH line} is equal to {EL line}, {BC line} is also equal to {MN line} [Prop. 3.14].
Again, since {AE line} is equal to {EM line}, and {ED line} to {EN line}, {AD line} is thus equal to {ME line} and {EN line}.
But, {ME line} and {EN line} is greater than {MN line} [Prop. 1.20], and {MN line} (is) equal to {BC line}.
Thus, {AD line} is greater than {BC line}.
And since the two (straight-lines) {ME line}, {EN line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {FE line}, {EG line} (respectively), and angle {MEN angle} [is] greater than angle {FEG angle}, the base {MN line} is thus greater than the base {FG line} [Prop. 1.24].
But, {MN line} was shown (to be) equal to {BC line}.
Thus, the diameter {AD line} (is) the greatest (straight-line), and {BC line} (is) greater than {FG line}.

Thus, in a circle, a diameter (is) the greatest (straight-line), and for the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the center is always greater than one further away.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
