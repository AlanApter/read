If some straight-line touches a circle, and a straight-line is drawn from the point of contact, at right-[angles] to the tangent, then the center (of the circle) will be on the (straight-line) so drawn.

For let some straight-line {DE line} touch the circle {ABC circle O} at point {C point}.
And let {CA line} have been drawn from {C point}, at right-angles to {DE line} [Prop. 1.11].
I say that the center of the circle is on {AC line}.

For (if) not, if possible, let {F point} be (the center of the circle), and let {CF line} have been joined.

[Therefore], since some straight-line {DE line} touches the circle {ABC circle O}, and {FC line} has been joined from the center to the point of contact, {FC line} is thus perpendicular to {DE line} [Prop. 3.18].
Thus, {FCE angle} is a right-angle.
And {ACE angle} is also a right-angle.
Thus, {FCE angle} is equal to {ACE angle}, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {F point} is not the center of circle {ABC circle O}.
So, similarly, we can show that neither is any (point) other (than one) on {AC line}.

Thus, if some straight-line touches a circle, and a straight-line is drawn from the point of contact, at right-angles to the tangent, then the center (of the circle) will be on the (straight-line) so drawn.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
