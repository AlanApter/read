To find a first binomial (straight-line).

Let two numbers {AC} and {CB} be laid down such that their sum {AB} has to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, and does not have to {CA} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
And let some rational (straight-line) {D} be laid down.
And let {EF} be commensurable in length with {D}.
{EF} is thus also rational [Def. 10.3].
And let it have been contrived that as the number {BA} (is) to {AC}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
And {AB} has to {AC} the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.
Thus, the (square) on {EF} also has to the (square) on {FG} the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.
Hence, the (square) on {EF} is commensurable with the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6].
And {EF} is rational.
Thus, {FG} (is) also rational.
And since {BA} does not have to {AC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, thus the (square) on {EF} does not have to the (square) on {FG} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF} is incommensurable in length with {FG} [Prop 10.9].
{EF} and {FG} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EG} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
I say that (it is) also a first (binomial straight-line).

For since as the number {BA} is to {AC}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG}, and {BA} (is) greater than {AC}, the (square) on {EF} (is) thus also greater than the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on {FG} and {H} be equal to the (square) on {EF}.
And since as {BA} is to {AC}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG}, thus, via conversion, as {AB} is to {BC}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {H} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {AB} has to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {EF} also has to the (square) on {H} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, {EF} is commensurable in length with {H} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, the square on {EF} is greater than (the square on) {FG} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({EF}).
And {EF} and {FG} are rational (straight-lines).
And {EF} (is) commensurable in length with {D}.

Thus, {EG} is a first binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.5].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
