To find a fourth binomial (straight-line).

Let the two numbers {AC} and {CB} be laid down such that {AB} does not have to {BC}, or to {AC} either, the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
And let the rational (straight-line) {D} be laid down.
And let {EF} be commensurable in length with {D}.
Thus, {EF} is also a rational (straight-line).
And let it have been contrived that as the number {BA} (is) to {AC}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {EF} is commensurable with the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, {FG} is also a rational (straight-line).
And since {BA} does not have to {AC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {EF} does not have to the (square) on {FG} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF} is incommensurable in length with {FG} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, {EF} and {FG} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Hence, {EG} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that (it is) also a fourth (binomial straight-line).

For since as {BA} is to {AC}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG} [and {BA} (is) greater than {AC}], the (square) on {EF} (is) thus greater than the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the squares on {FG} and {H} be equal to the (square) on {EF}.
Thus, via conversion, as the number {AB} (is) to {BC}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {H} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {AB} does not have to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {EF} does not have to the (square) on {H} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF} is incommensurable in length with {H} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, the square on {EF} is greater than (the square on) {GF} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({EF}).
And {EF} and {FG} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And {EF} is commensurable in length with {D}.

Thus, {EG} is a fourth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.8].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
