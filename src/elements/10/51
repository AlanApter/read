To find a fourth binomial (straight-line).

Let the two numbers {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} be laid down such that {AB magnitude} does not have to {BC magnitude}, or to {AC magnitude} either, the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
And let the rational (straight-line) {D magnitude} be laid down.
And let {EF magnitude} be commensurable in length with {D magnitude}.
Thus, {EF magnitude} is also a rational (straight-line).
And let it have been contrived that as the number {BA magnitude} (is) to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {EF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {EF magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, {FG magnitude} is also a rational (straight-line).
And since {BA magnitude} does not have to {AC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {EF magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {FG magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, {EF magnitude} and {FG magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Hence, {EG magnitude} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that (it is) also a fourth (binomial straight-line).

For since as {BA magnitude} is to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {EF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude} [and {BA magnitude} (is) greater than {AC magnitude}], the (square) on {EF magnitude} (is) thus greater than the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the squares on {FG magnitude} and {H magnitude} be equal to the (square) on {EF magnitude}.
Thus, via conversion, as the number {AB magnitude} (is) to {BC magnitude}, so the (square) on {EF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {H magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {AB magnitude} does not have to {BC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {EF magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {H magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {H magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, the square on {EF magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GF magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({EF magnitude}).
And {EF magnitude} and {FG magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And {EF magnitude} is commensurable in length with {D magnitude}.

Thus, {EG magnitude} is a fourth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.8].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
