A medial (area), incommensurable with the whole, being subtracted from a medial (area), the two remaining irrational (straight-lines) arise (as) the (square-root of the area)---either a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), or that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.

For, as in the previous figures, let the medial (area) {BD polygon}, incommensurable with the whole, have been subtracted from the medial (area) {BC polygon}.
I say that the square-root of {EC polygon} is one of two irrational (straight-lines)---either a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), or that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.

For since {BC polygon} and {BD polygon} are each medial (areas), and {BC polygon} (is) incommensurable with {BD polygon}, accordingly, {FH line} and {FK line} will each be rational (straight-lines), and incommensurable in length with {FG line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {BC polygon} is incommensurable with {BD polygon}---that is to say, {GH polygon} with {GK polygon}---{HF line} (is) also incommensurable (in length) with {FK line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
Thus, {FH line} and {FK line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{KH line} is thus as apotome [Prop. 10.73], [and {FK line} an attachment (to it).
So, the square on {FH line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable, or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable, (in length) with({FH line}).]

So, if the square on {FH line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({FH line}), and (since) neither of {FH line} and {FK line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {FG line}, {KH line} is a third apotome [Def. 10.3].
And {KL line} (is) rational.
And the rectangle contained by a rational (straight-line) and a third apotome is irrational, and the square-root of it is that irrational (straight-line) called a second apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.93].
Hence, the square-root of {LH polygon}---that is to say, (of) {EC polygon}---is a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

And if the square on {FH line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable [in length] with ({FH line}), and (since) neither of {HF line} and {FK line} is commensurable in length with {FG line}, {KH line} is a sixth apotome [Def. 10.16].
And the square-root of the (rectangle contained) by a rational (straight-line) and a sixth apotome is that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole [Prop. 10.96].
Thus, the square-root of {LH polygon}---that is to say, (of) {EC polygon}---is that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
