If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a sixth binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

For let the area {ABCD polygon} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB line} and the sixth binomial (straight-line) {AD line}, which has been divided into its (component) terms at {E point}, such that {AE line} is the greater term.
So, I say that the square-root of {AC polygon} is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

[For] let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
So, (it is) clear that {MO line} is the square-root of {AC polygon}, and that {MN line} is incommensurable in square with {NO line}.
And since {EA line} is incommensurable in length with {AB line} [Def. 10.10], {EA line} and {AB line} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {AK polygon} ---that is to say, the sum of the (squares) on {MN line} and {NO line}---is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Again, since {ED line} is incommensurable in length with {AB line} [Def. 10.10], {FE line} is thus also incommensurable (in length) with {EK line} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {FE line} and {EK line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EL polygon}---that is to say, {MR polygon}---that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by {MN line} and {NO line}---is medial [Prop. 10.21].
And since {AE line} is incommensurable (in length) with {EF line}, {AK polygon} is also incommensurable with {EL polygon} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
But, {AK polygon} is the sum of the (squares) on {MN line} and {NO line}, and {EL polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {MN line} and {NO line}.
Thus, the sum of the (squares) on {MN line} and {NO line} is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {MN line} and {NO line}.
And each of them is medial.
And {MN line} and {NO line} are incommensurable in square.

Thus, {MO line} is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) [Prop. 10.41].
And (it is) the square-root of {AC polygon}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
