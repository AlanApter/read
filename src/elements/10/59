If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a sixth binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

For let the area {ABCD} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB} and the sixth binomial (straight-line) {AD}, which has been divided into its (component) terms at {E}, such that {AE} is the greater term.
So, I say that the square-root of {AC} is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

[For] let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
So, (it is) clear that {MO} is the square-root of {AC}, and that {MN} is incommensurable in square with {NO}.
And since {EA} is incommensurable in length with {AB} [Def. 10.10], {EA} and {AB} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {AK} ---that is to say, the sum of the (squares) on {MN} and {NO}---is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Again, since {ED} is incommensurable in length with {AB} [Def. 10.10], {FE} is thus also incommensurable (in length) with {EK} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {FE} and {EK} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EL}---that is to say, {MR}---that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by {MNO}---is medial [Prop. 10.21].
And since {AE} is incommensurable (in length) with {EF}, {AK} is also incommensurable with {EL} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
But, {AK} is the sum of the (squares) on {MN} and {NO}, and {EL} is the (rectangle contained) by {MNO}.
Thus, the sum of the (squares) on {MNO} is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {MNO}.
And each of them is medial.
And {MN} and {NO} are incommensurable in square.

Thus, {MO} is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) [Prop. 10.41].
And (it is) the square-root of {AC}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
