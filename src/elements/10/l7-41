We will now demonstrate that the aforementioned irrational (straight-lines) are uniquely divided into the straight-lines of which they are the sum, and which produce the prescribed types, (after) setting forth the following lemma.

Let the straight-line {AB} be laid out, and let the whole (straight-line) have been cut into unequal parts at each of the (points) {C} and {D}.
And let {AC} be assumed (to be) greater than {DB}.
I say that (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD} and {DB}.

For let {AB} have been cut in half at {E}.
And since {AC} is greater than {DB}, let {DC} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remainder {AD} is greater than the remainder {CB}.
And {AE} (is) equal to {EB}.
Thus, {DE} (is) less than {EC}.
Thus, points {C} and {D} are not equally far from the point of bisection.
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}, plus the (square) on {EC}, is equal to the (square) on {EB} [Prop. 2.5], but, moreover, the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB}, plus the (square) on {DE}, is also equal to the (square) on {EB} [Prop. 2.5], the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}, plus the (square) on {EC}, is thus equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB}, plus the (square) on {DE}.
And, of these, the (square) on {DE} is less than the (square) on {EC}.
And, thus, the remaining (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is less than the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB}.
And, hence, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is less than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB}.
And thus the remaining sum of the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is greater than the sum of the (squares) on {AD} and {DB}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
