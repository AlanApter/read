If two straight-lines (which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them rational, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial, are added together then the whole straight-line is irrational---let it be called a major (straight-line).

For let the two straight-lines, {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, incommensurable in square, and fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [Prop. 10.33].
I say that {AC magnitude} is irrational.

For since the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is medial, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is [thus] also medial [Props. 10.6, 10.23 corr.].
And the sum of the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} is incommensurable with the sum of the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Def. 10.4].
Hence, (the sum of) the squares on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}, plus twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude}---that is, the (square) on {AC magnitude} [Prop. 2.4]---is also incommensurable with the sum of the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.16] [and the sum of the (squares) on {AB magnitude} and {BC magnitude} (is) rational].
Thus, the (square) on {AC magnitude} is irrational.
Hence, {AC magnitude} is also irrational [Def. 10.4]---let it be called a major (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
