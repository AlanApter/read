The (square) on a rational (straight-line), applied to an apotome, produces as breadth a binomial whose terms are commensurable with the terms of the apotome, and in the same ratio.
Moreover, the created binomial has the same order as the apotome.

Let {A} be a rational (straight-line), and {BD} an apotome.
And let the (rectangle contained) by {BD} and {KH} be equal to the (square) on {A}, such that the square on the rational (straight-line) {A}, applied to the apotome {BD}, produces {KH} as breadth.
I say that {KH} is a binomial whose terms are commensurable with the terms of {BD}, and in the same ratio, and, moreover, that {KH} has the same order as {BD}.

For let {DC} be an attachment to {BD}.
Thus, {BC} and {CD} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And let the (rectangle contained) by {BC} and {G} also be equal to the (square) on {A}.
And the (square) on {A} (is) rational.
The (rectangle contained) by {BC} and {G} (is) thus also rational.
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {BC}.
Thus, {G} is rational, and commensurable in length with {BC} [Prop. 10.20].
Therefore, since the (rectangle contained) by {BC} and {G} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {BD} and {KH}, thus, proportionally, as {CB} is to {BD}, so {KH} (is) to {G} [Prop. 6.16].
And {BC} (is) greater than {BD}.
Thus, {KH} (is) also greater than {G} [Prop. 5.16, 5.14].
Let {KE} be made equal to {G}.
{KE} is thus commensurable in length with {BC}.
And since as {CB} is to {BD}, so {HK} (is) to {KE}, thus, via conversion, as {BC} (is) to {CD}, so {KH} (is) to {HE} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
Let it have been contrived that as {KH} (is) to {HE}, so {HF} (is) to {FE}.
And thus the remainder {KF} is to {FH}, as {KH} (is) to {HE}---that is to say, [as] {BC} (is) to {CD} [Prop. 5.19].
And {BC} and {CD} [are] commensurable in square only.

{KF} and {FH} are thus also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].
And since as {KH} is to {HE}, (so) {KF} (is) to {FH}, but as {KH} (is) to {HE}, (so) {HF} (is) to {FE}, thus, also as {KF} (is) to {FH}, (so) {HF} (is) to {FE} [Prop. 5.11].
And hence as the first (is) to the third, so the (square) on the first (is) to the (square) on the second [Def. 5.9].
And thus as {KF} (is) to {FE}, so the (square) on {KF} (is) to the (square) on {FH}.
And the (square) on {KF} is commensurable with the (square) on {FH}.
For {KF} and {FH} are commensurable in square.
Thus, {KF} is also commensurable in length with {FE} [Prop. 10.11].
Hence, {KF} [is] also commensurable in length with {KE} [Prop. 10.15].
And {KE} is rational, and commensurable in length with {BC}.
Thus, {KF} (is) also rational, and commensurable in length with {BC} [Prop. 10.12].
And since as {BC} is to {CD}, (so) {KF} (is) to {FH}, alternately, as {BC} (is) to {KF}, so {DC} (is) to {FH} [Prop. 5.16].
And {BC} (is) commensurable (in length) with {KF}.
Thus, {FH} (is) also commensurable in length with {CD} [Prop. 10.11].
And {BC} and {CD} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{KF} and {FH} are thus also rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Def. 10.3, Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {KH} is a binomial [Prop. 10.36].

Therefore, if the square on {BC} is greater than (the square on) {CD} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({BC}), then the square on {KF} will also be greater than (the square on) {FH} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({KF}) [Prop. 10.14].
And if {BC} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) {KF} [Prop. 10.12].
And if {CD} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) {FH} [Prop. 10.12].
And if neither of {BC} or {CD} (are commensurable), neither also (are) either of {KF} or {FH} [Prop. 10.13].

And if the square on {BC} is greater than (the square on) {CD} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({BC}) then the square on {KF} will also be greater than (the square on) {FH} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({KF}) [Prop. 10.14].
And if {BC} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) {KF} [Prop. 10.12].
And if {CD} is commensurable, (so) also (is) {FH} [Prop. 10.12].
And if neither of {BC} or {CD} (are commensurable), neither also (are) either of {KF} or {FH} [Prop. 10.13].

{KH} is thus a binomial whose terms, {KF} and {FH}, [are] commensurable (in length) with the terms, {BC} and {CD}, of the apotome, and in the same ratio.
Moreover, {KH} will have the same order as {BC} [Defs. 10.5-10.10].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
