A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with a (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole is a (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole.

Let {AB magnitude} be a (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole, and (let) {CD magnitude} (be) commensurable (in length) with {AB magnitude}.
I say that {CD magnitude} is also a (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial (whole).

For let {BE magnitude} be an attachment to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them rational [Prop. 10.77].
And let the same construction have been made (as in the previous propositions).
So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can show that {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are in the same ratio as {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude}, and the sum of the squares on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is commensurable with the sum of the squares on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}, and the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} with the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}.
Hence, {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are also (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them rational.

{CD magnitude} is thus a (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole [Prop. 10.77].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
