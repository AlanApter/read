If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a second binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called first bimedial.

For let the area {ABCD} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB} and by the second binomial (straight-line) {AD}.
I say that the square-root of area {AC} is a first bimedial(straight-line).

For since {AD} is a second binomial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at {E}, such that {AE} is the greater term.
Thus, {AE} and {ED} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {AE} is greater than (the square on) {ED} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE}), and the lesser term {ED} is commensurable in length with {AB} [Def. 10.6].
Let {ED} have been cut in half at {F}.
And let the (rectangle contained) by {AGE}, equal to the (square) on {EF}, have been applied to {AE}, falling short by a square figure.
{AG} (is) thus commensurable in length with {GE} [Prop. 10.17].
And let {GH}, {EK}, and {FL} have been drawn through (points) {G}, {E}, and {F} (respectively), parallel to {AB} and {CD}.
And let the square {SN}, equal to the parallelogram {AH}, have been constructed, and the square {NQ}, equal to {GK}.
And let {MN} be laid down so as to be straight-on to {NO}.
Thus, {RN} [is] also straight-on to {NP}.
And let the square {SQ} have been completed.
So, (it is) clear from what has been previously demonstrated [Prop. 10.53 lem.] that {MR} is the mean proportional to {SN} and {NQ}, and (is) equal to {EL}, and that {MO} is the square-root of the area {AC}.
So, we must show that {MO} is a first bimedial (straight-line).

Since {AE} is incommensurable in length with {ED}, and {ED} (is) commensurable (in length) with {AB}, {AE} (is) thus incommensurable (in length) with {AB} [Prop. 10.13].
And since {AG} is commensurable (in length) with {EG}, {AE} is also commensurable (in length) with each of {AG} and {GE} [Prop. 10.15].
But, {AE} is incommensurable in length with {AB}.
Thus, {AG} and {GE} are also (both) incommensurable (in length) with {AB} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {BA}, {AG}, and ({BA}, and) {GE} are (pairs of) rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And, hence, each of {AH} and {GK} is a medial (area) [Prop. 10.21].
Hence, each of {SN} and {NQ} is also a medial (area).
Thus, {MN} and {NO} are medial (straight-lines).
And since {AG} (is) commensurable in length with {GE}, {AH} is also commensurable with {GK} ---that is to say, {SN} with {NQ}---that is to say, the (square) on {MN} with the (square) on {NO} [hence, {MN} and {NO} are commensurable in square] [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And since {AE} is incommensurable in length with {ED}, but {AE} is commensurable (in length) with {AG}, and {ED} commensurable (in length) with {EF}, {AG} (is) thus incommensurable (in length) with {EF} [Prop. 10.13].
Hence, {AH} is also incommensurable with {EL}---that is to say, {SN} with {MR}---that is to say, {PN} with {NR}---that is to say, {MN} is incommensurable in length with {NO} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
But {MN} and {NO} have also been shown to be medial (straight-lines) which are commensurable in square.
Thus, {MN} and {NO} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
So, I say that they also contain a rational (area).
For since {DE} was assumed (to be) commensurable (in length) with each of {AB} and {EF}, {EF} (is) thus also commensurable with {EK} [Prop. 10.12].
And they (are) each rational.
Thus, {EL}---that is to say, {MR}---(is) rational [Prop. 10.19].
And {MR} is the (rectangle contained) by {MNO}.
And if two medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, which contain a rational (area), are added together, then the whole is (that) irrational (straight-line which is) called first bimedial [Prop. 10.37].

Thus, {MO} is a first bimedial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
