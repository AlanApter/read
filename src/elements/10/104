A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with an apotome of a medial (straight-line) is an apotome of a medial (straight-line), and (is) the same in order.

Let {AB} be an apotome of a medial (straight-line), and let {CD} be commensurable in length with {AB}.
I say that {CD} is also an apotome of a medial (straight-line), and (is) the same in order as {AB}.

For since {AB} is an apotome of a medial (straight-line), let {EB} be an attachment to it.
Thus, {AE} and {EB} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Props. 10.74, 10.75].
And let it have been contrived that as {AB} is to {CD}, so {BE} (is) to {DF} [Prop. 6.12].
Thus, {AE} [is] also commensurable (in length) with {CF}, and {BE} with {DF} [Props. 5.12, 10.11].
And {AE} and {EB} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF} and {FD} are thus also medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Props. 10.23, 10.13].
Thus, {CD} is an apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Props. 10.74, 10.75].
So, {I} say that it is also the same in order as {AB}.

[For] since as {AE} is to {EB}, so {CF} (is) to {FD} [Props. 5.12, 5.16] [but as {AE} (is) to {EB}, so the (square) on {AE} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {AE} and {EB}, and as {CF} (is) to {FD}, so the (square) on {CF} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CF} and {FD}], thus as the (square) on {AE} is to the (rectangle contained) by {AE} and {EB}, so the (square) on {CF} also (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CF} and {FD} [Prop. 10.21 lem.] [and, alternately, as the (square) on {AE} (is) to the (square) on {CF}, so the (rectangle contained) by {AE} and {EB} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CF} and {FD}].
And the (square) on {AE} (is) commensurable with the (square) on {CF}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AE} and {EB} is also commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {CF} and {FD} [Props. 5.16, 10.11].
Therefore, either the (rectangle contained) by {AE} and {EB} is rational, and the (rectangle contained) by {CF} and {FD} will also be rational [Def. 10.4], or the (rectangle contained) by {AE} and {EB} [is] medial, and the (rectangle contained) by {CF} and {FD} [is] also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].

Therefore, {CD} is the apotome of a medial (straight-line), and is the same in order as {AB} [Props. 10.74, 10.75].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
