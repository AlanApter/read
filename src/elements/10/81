Only one medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a medial (area) with the whole, can be attached to a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

Let {AB} be a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), with {BC} (so) attached to {AB}.
Thus, {AC} and {CB} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a medial (area)---(namely, that contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.75].
I say that a(nother) medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a medial (area) with the whole, cannot be attached to {AB}.

For, if possible, let {BD} be (so) attached.
Thus, {AD} and {DB} are also medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a medial (area)---(namely, that contained) by {AD} and {DB} [Prop. 10.75].
And let the rational (straight-line) {EF} be laid down.
And let {EG}, equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AC} and {CB}, have been applied to {EF}, producing {EM} as breadth.
And let {HG}, equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}, have been subtracted (from {EG}), producing {HM} as breadth.
The remainder {EL} is thus equal to the (square) on {AB} [Prop. 2.7].
Hence, {AB} is the square-root of {EL}.
So, again, let {EI}, equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AD} and {DB} have been applied to {EF}, producing {EN} as breadth.
And {EL} is also equal to the square on {AB}.
Thus, the remainder {HI} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB} [Prop. 2.7].
And since {AC} and {CB} are (both) medial (straight-lines), the (sum of the squares) on {AC} and {CB} is also medial.
And it is equal to {EG}.
Thus, {EG} is also medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}, producing {EM} as breadth.
Thus, {EM} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.22].
Again, since the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is medial, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
And it is equal to {HG}.
Thus, {HG} is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}, producing {HM} as breadth.
Thus, {HM} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {AC} and {CB} are commensurable in square only, {AC} is thus incommensurable in length with {CB}.
And as {AC} (is) to {CB}, so the (square) on {AC} is to the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.21 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {AC} is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.11].
But, the (sum of the squares) on {AC} and {CB} is commensurable with the (square) on {AC}, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {AC} and {CB} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.13].
And {EG} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AC} and {CB}.
And {GH} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}.
Thus, {EG} is incommensurable with {HG}.
And as {EG} (is) to {HG}, so {EM} is to {HM} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EM} is incommensurable in length with {MH} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {EM} and {MH} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EH} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73], and {HM} (is) attached to it.
So, similarly, we can show that {HN} (is) also (commensurable in square only with {EN} and is) attached to ({EH}).
Thus, different straight-lines, which are commensurable in square only with the whole, are attached to an apotome.
The very thing is impossible [Prop. 10.79].

Thus, only one medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a medial (area) with the whole, can be attached to a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
