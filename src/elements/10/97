The (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a first apotome as breadth.

Let {AB} be an apotome, and {CD} a rational (straight-line).
And let {CE}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {CD}, producing {CF} as breadth.
I say that {CF} is a first apotome.

For let {BG} be an attachment to {AB}.
Thus, {AG} and {GB} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And let {CH}, equal to the (square) on {AG}, and {KL}, (equal) to the (square) on {BG}, have been applied to {CD}.
Thus, the whole of {CL} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}, of which {CE} is equal to the (square) on {AB}.
The remainder {FL} is thus equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} [Prop. 2.7].
Let {FM} have been cut in half at point {N}.
And let {NO} have been drawn through {N}, parallel to {CD}.
Thus, {FO} and {LN} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}.
And since the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB} is rational, and {DM} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}, {DM} is thus rational.
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD}, producing {CM} as breadth.
Thus, {CM} is rational, and commensurable in length with {CD} [Prop. 10.20].
Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} is medial, and {FL} (is) equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}, {FL} (is) thus a medial (area).
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD}, producing {FM} as breadth.
{FM} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD} [Prop. 10.22].
And since the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB} is rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} medial, the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}.
And {CL} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}, and {FL} to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}.
{DM} is thus incommensurable with {FL}.
And as {DM} (is) to {FL}, so {CM} is to {FM} [Prop. 6.1].
{CM} is thus incommensurable in length with {FM} [Prop. 10.11].
And both are rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {CM} and {MF} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a first (apotome).

For since the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} is the mean proportional to the (squares) on {AG} and {GB} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and {CH} is equal to the (square) on {AG}, and {KL} equal to the (square) on {BG}, and {NL} to the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}, {NL} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH} and {KL}.
Thus, as {CH} is to {NL}, so {NL} (is) to {KL}.
But, as {CH} (is) to {NL}, so {CK} is to {NM}, and as {NL} (is) to {KL}, so {NM} is to {KM} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {CK} and {KM} is equal to the (square) on {NM}---that is to say, to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM} [Prop. 6.17].
And since the (square) on {AG} is commensurable with the (square) on {GB}, {CH} [is] also commensurable with {KL}.
And as {CH} (is) to {KL}, so {CK} (is) to {KM} [Prop. 6.1].
{CK} is thus commensurable (in length) with {KM} [Prop. 10.11].
Therefore, since {CM} and {MF} are two unequal straight-lines, and the (rectangle contained) by {CK} and {KM}, equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM}, has been applied to {CM}, falling short by a square figure, and {CK} is commensurable (in length) with {KM}, the square on {CM} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({CM}) [Prop. 10.17].
And {CM} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD}.
Thus, {CF} is a first apotome [Def. 10.15].

Thus, the (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a first apotome as breadth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
