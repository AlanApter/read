To find (two) medial (straight-lines), containing a rational (area), (which are) commensurable in square only.

Let the two rational (straight-lines) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid down.
And let {C magnitude}---the mean proportional (straight-line) to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}---have been taken [Prop. 6.13].
And let it be contrived that as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 6.12].

And since the rational (straight-lines) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are commensurable in square only, the (rectangle contained) by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}---that is to say, the (square) on {C magnitude} [Prop. 6.17]---is thus medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, {C magnitude} is medial [Prop. 10.21].
And since as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, [so] {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, and {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} [are] commensurable in square only, {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} are thus also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].
And {C magnitude} is medial.
Thus, {D magnitude} is also medial [Prop. 10.23].
Thus, {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
I say that they also contain a rational (area).
For since as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, thus, alternately, as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].
But, as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, (so) {C magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
And thus as {C magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} is equal to the (square) on {B magnitude} [Prop. 6.17].
And the (square) on {B magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} [is] also rational.

Thus, (two) medial (straight-lines, {C magnitude} and {D magnitude}), containing a rational (area), (which are) commensurable in square only, have been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
