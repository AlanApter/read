If two straight-lines (which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them rational, are added together then the whole straight-line is irrational---let it be called the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).

For let the two straight-lines, {AB} and {BC}, incommensurable in square, (and) fulfilling the prescribed (conditions), be laid down together [Prop. 10.34].
I say that {AC} is irrational.

For since the sum of the (squares) on {AB} and {BC} is medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} (is) rational, the sum of the (squares) on {AB} and {BC} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC}.
Hence, the (square) on {AC} is also incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} [Prop. 10.16].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} (is) rational.
The (square) on {AC} (is) thus irrational.
Thus, {AC} (is) irrational [Def. 10.4]---let it be called the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
