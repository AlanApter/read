To find a second apotome.

Let the rational (straight-line) {A}, and {GC} (which is) commensurable in length with {A}, be laid down.
Thus, {GC} is a rational (straight-line).
And let the two square numbers {DE} and {EF} be laid down, and let their difference {DF} be not square [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
And let it have been contrived that as {FD} (is) to {DE}, so the square on {CG} (is) to the square on {GB} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the square on {CG} is commensurable with the square on {GB} [Prop. 10.6].
And the (square) on {CG} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {GB} [is] also rational.
Thus, {BG} is a rational (straight-line).
And since the square on {GC} does not have to the (square) on {GB} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, {CG} is incommensurable in length with {GB} [Prop. 10.9].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {CG} and {GB} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {BC} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that it is also a second (apotome).

For let the (square) on {H} be that (area) by which the (square) on {BG} is greater than the (square) on {GC} [Prop. 10.13 lem.].
Therefore, since as the (square) on {BG} is to the (square) on {GC}, so the number {ED} (is) to the number {DF}, thus, also, via conversion, as the (square) on {BG} is to the (square) on {H}, so {DE} (is) to {EF} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {DE} and {EF} are each square (numbers).
Thus, the (square) on {BG} has to the (square) on {H} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, {BG} is commensurable in length with {H} [Prop. 10.9].
And the square on {BG} is greater than (the square on) {GC} by the (square) on {H}.
Thus, the square on {BG} is greater than (the square on) {GC} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({BG}).
And the attachment {CG} is commensurable (in length) with the (prevously) laid down rational (straight-line) {A}.
Thus, {BC} is a second apotome [Def. 10.12].

Thus, the second apotome {BC} has been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
