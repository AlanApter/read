If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first apotome then the square-root of the area is an apotome.

For let the area {AB polygon} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC line} and the first apotome {AD line}.
I say that the square-root of area {AB polygon} is an apotome.

For since {AD line} is a first apotome, let {DG line} be its attachment.
Thus, {AG line} and {DG line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And the whole, {AG line}, is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC line}, and the square on {AG line} is greater than (the square on) {GD line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({AG line}) [Def. 10.11].
Thus, if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {DG line} is applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG line}) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].
Let {DG line} have been cut in half at {E point}.
And let (an area) equal to the (square) on {EG line} have been applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure.
And let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line}.
{AF line} is thus commensurable (in length) with {FG line}.
And let {EH line}, {FI line}, and {GK line} have been drawn through points {E point}, {F point}, and {G point} (respectively), parallel to {AC line}.

And since {AF line} is commensurable in length with {FG line}, {AG line} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {AF line} and {FG line} [Prop. 10.15].
But {AG line} is commensurable (in length) with {AC line}.
Thus, each of {AF line} and {FG line} is also commensurable in length with {AC line} [Prop. 10.12].
And {AC line} is a rational (straight-line).
Thus, {AF line} and {FG line} (are) each also rational (straight-lines).
Hence, {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} are also each rational (areas) [Prop. 10.19].
And since {DE line} is commensurable in length with {EG line}, {DG line} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {DE line} and {EG line} [Prop. 10.15].
And {DG line} (is) rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line}.
{DE line} and {EG line} (are) thus each rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {DH polygon} and {EK polygon} are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].

So let the square {LM polygon}, equal to {AI polygon}, be laid down.
And let the square {NO polygon}, equal to {FK polygon}, have been subtracted (from {LM polygon}), having with it the common angle {LPM angle}.
Thus, the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].
Let {PR line} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
Therefore, since the rectangle contained by {AF line} and {FG line} is equal to the square {EG line}, thus as {AF line} is to {EG line}, so {EG line} (is) to {FG line} [Prop. 6.17].
But, as {AF line} (is) to {EG line}, so {AI polygon} (is) to {EK polygon}, and as {EG line} (is) to {FG line}, so {EK polygon} is to {KF polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EK polygon} is the mean proportional to {AI polygon} and {KF polygon} [Prop. 5.11].
And {MN polygon} is also the mean proportional to {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}, as shown before [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
And {AI polygon} is equal to the square {LM polygon}, and {KF polygon} to {NO polygon}.
Thus, {MN polygon} is also equal to {EK polygon}.
But, {EK polygon} is equal to {DH polygon}, and {MN polygon} to {LO polygon} [Prop. 1.43].
Thus, {DK polygon} is equal to the gnomon {UVW given} and {NO polygon}.
And {AK polygon} is also equal to (the sum of) the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}.
Thus, the remainder {AB polygon} is equal to {ST polygon}.
And {ST polygon} is the square on {LN line}.
Thus, the square on {LN line} is equal to {AB polygon}.
Thus, {LN line} is the square-root of {AB polygon}.
So, I say that {LN line} is an apotome.

For since {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} are each rational (areas), and are equal to {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} (respectively), thus {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}---that is to say, the (squares) on each of {LP line} and {PN line} (respectively)---are also each rational (areas).
Thus, {LP line} and {PN line} are also each rational (straight-lines).
Again, since {DH polygon} is a medial (area), and is equal to {LO polygon}, {LO polygon} is thus also a medial (area).
Therefore, since {LO polygon} is medial, and {NO polygon} rational, {LO polygon} is thus incommensurable with {NO polygon}.
And as {LO polygon} (is) to {NO polygon}, so {LP line} is to {PN line} [Prop. 6.1].
{LP line} is thus incommensurable in length with {PN line} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {LP line} and {PN line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {LN line} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
And it is the square-root of area {AB polygon}.
Thus, the square-root of area {AB polygon} is an apotome.

Thus, if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line), and so on ....
