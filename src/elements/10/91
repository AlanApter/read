If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first apotome then the square-root of the area is an apotome.

For let the area {AB} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC} and the first apotome {AD}.
I say that the square-root of area {AB} is an apotome.

For since {AD} is a first apotome, let {DG} be its attachment.
Thus, {AG} and {DG} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And the whole, {AG}, is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC}, and the square on {AG} is greater than (the square on) {GD} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({AG}) [Def. 10.11].
Thus, if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {DG} is applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG}) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].
Let {DG} have been cut in half at {E}.
And let (an area) equal to the (square) on {EG} have been applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure.
And let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF} and {FG}.
{AF} is thus commensurable (in length) with {FG}.
And let {EH}, {FI}, and {GK} have been drawn through points {E}, {F}, and {G} (respectively), parallel to {AC}.

And since {AF} is commensurable in length with {FG}, {AG} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {AF} and {FG} [Prop. 10.15].
But {AG} is commensurable (in length) with {AC}.
Thus, each of {AF} and {FG} is also commensurable in length with {AC} [Prop. 10.12].
And {AC} is a rational (straight-line).
Thus, {AF} and {FG} (are) each also rational (straight-lines).
Hence, {AI} and {FK} are also each rational (areas) [Prop. 10.19].
And since {DE} is commensurable in length with {EG}, {DG} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {DE} and {EG} [Prop. 10.15].
And {DG} (is) rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC}.
{DE} and {EG} (are) thus each rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {DH} and {EK} are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].

So let the square {LM}, equal to {AI}, be laid down.
And let the square {NO}, equal to {FK}, have been subtracted (from {LM}), having with it the common angle {LPM}.
Thus, the squares {LM} and {NO} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].
Let {PR} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
Therefore, since the rectangle contained by {AF} and {FG} is equal to the square {EG}, thus as {AF} is to {EG}, so {EG} (is) to {FG} [Prop. 6.17].
But, as {AF} (is) to {EG}, so {AI} (is) to {EK}, and as {EG} (is) to {FG}, so {EK} is to {KF} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EK} is the mean proportional to {AI} and {KF} [Prop. 5.11].
And {MN} is also the mean proportional to {LM} and {NO}, as shown before [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
And {AI} is equal to the square {LM}, and {KF} to {NO}.
Thus, {MN} is also equal to {EK}.
But, {EK} is equal to {DH}, and {MN} to {LO} [Prop. 1.43].
Thus, {DK} is equal to the gnomon {UVW} and {NO}.
And {AK} is also equal to (the sum of) the squares {LM} and {NO}.
Thus, the remainder {AB} is equal to {ST}.
And {ST} is the square on {LN}.
Thus, the square on {LN} is equal to {AB}.
Thus, {LN} is the square-root of {AB}.
So, I say that {LN} is an apotome.

For since {AI} and {FK} are each rational (areas), and are equal to {LM} and {NO} (respectively), thus {LM} and {NO}---that is to say, the (squares) on each of {LP} and {PN} (respectively)---are also each rational (areas).
Thus, {LP} and {PN} are also each rational (straight-lines).
Again, since {DH} is a medial (area), and is equal to {LO}, {LO} is thus also a medial (area).
Therefore, since {LO} is medial, and {NO} rational, {LO} is thus incommensurable with {NO}.
And as {LO} (is) to {NO}, so {LP} is to {PN} [Prop. 6.1].
{LP} is thus incommensurable in length with {PN} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {LP} and {PN} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {LN} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
And it is the square-root of area {AB}.
Thus, the square-root of area {AB} is an apotome.

Thus, if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line), and so on ....
