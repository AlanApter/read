The square on a second bimedial (straight-line) applied to a rational (straight-line) produces as breadth a third binomial (straight-line).

Let {AB} be a second bimedial (straight-line) having been divided into its (component) medial (straight-lines) at {C}, such that {AC} is the greater segment.
And let {DE} be some rational (straight-line).
And let the parallelogram {DF}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {DE}, producing {DG} as breadth.
I say that {DG} is a third binomial (straight-line).

Let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
And since {AB} is a second bimedial (straight-line), having been divided at {C}, {AC} and {CB} are thus medial (straight-lines) commensurable in square only, and containing a medial (area) [Prop. 10.38].
Hence, the sum of the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is also medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it is equal to {DL}.
Thus, {DL} (is) also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {DE}.
{MD} is thus also rational, and incommensurable in length with {DE} [Prop.
10.22].
So, for the same (reasons), {MG} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {ML}---that is to say, with {DE}.
Thus, {DM} and {MG} are each rational, and incommensurable in length with {DE}.
And since {AC} is incommensurable in length with {CB}, and as {AC} (is) to {CB}, so the (square) on {AC} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {ACB} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], the (square) on {AC} (is) also incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {ACB} [Prop. 10.11].
And hence the sum of the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {ACB}---that is to say, {DL} with {MF} [Props. 10.12, 10.13].
Hence, {DM} is also incommensurable (in length) with {MG} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And they are rational.
{DG} is thus a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
[So] we must show that (it is) also a third (binomial straight-line).

So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can conclude that {DM} is greater than {MG}, and {DK} (is) commensurable (in length) with {KM}.
And the (rectangle contained) by {DKM} is equal to the (square) on {MN}.
Thus, the square on {DM} is greater than (the square on) {MG} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DM}) [Prop. 10.17].
And neither of {DM} and {MG} is commensurable in length with {DE}.

Thus, {DG} is a third binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.7].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
