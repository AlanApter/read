If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a second apotome then the square-root of the area is a first apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For let the area {AB} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC} and the second apotome {AD}.
I say that the square-root of area {AB} is the first apotome of a medial(straight-line).

For let {DG} be an attachment to {AD}.
Thus, {AG} and {GD} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73], and the attachment {DG} is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC}, and the square on the whole, {AG}, is greater than (the square on) the attachment, {GD}, by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({AG}) [Def. 10.12].
Therefore, since the square on {AG} is greater than (the square on) {GD} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AG}), thus if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {GD} is applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG}) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].
Therefore, let {DG} have been cut in half at {E}.
And let (an area) equal to the (square) on {EG} have been applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure.
And let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF} and {FG}.
Thus, {AF} is commensurable in length with {FG}.
{AG} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {AF} and {FG} [Prop. 10.15].
And {AG} (is) a rational (straight-line), and incommensurable in length with {AC}.
{AF} and {FG} are thus also each rational (straight-lines), and incommensurable in length with {AC} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {AI} and {FK} are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].
Again, since {DE} is commensurable (in length) with {EG}, thus {DG} is also commensurable (in length) with each of {DE} and {EG} [Prop. 10.15].
But, {DG} is commensurable in length with {AC} [thus, {DE} and {EG} are also each rational, and commensurable in length with {AC}].
Thus, {DH} and {EK} are each rational (areas) [Prop. 10.19].

Therefore, let the square {LM}, equal to {AI}, have been constructed.
And let {NO}, equal to {FK}, which is about the same angle {LPM} as {LM}, have been subtracted (from {LM}).
Thus, the squares {LM} and {NO} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].
Let {PR} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
Therefore, since {AI} and {FK} are medial (areas), and are equal to the (squares) on {LP} and {PN} (respectively), [thus] the (squares) on {LP} and {PN} are also medial.
Thus, {LP} and {PN} are also medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AF} and {FG} is equal to the (square) on {EG}, thus as {AF} is to {EG}, so {EG} (is) to {FG} [Prop. 10.17].
But, as {AF} (is) to {EG}, so {AI} (is) to {EK}.
Andas {EG} (is) to {FG}, so {EK} [is] to {FK} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EK} is the mean proportional to {AI} and {FK} [Prop. 5.11].
And {MN} is also the mean proportional to the squares {LM} and {NO} [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
And {AI} is equal to {LM}, and {FK} to {NO}.
Thus, {MN} is also equal to {EK}.
But, {DH} [is] equal to {EK}, and {LO} equal to {MN} [Prop. 1.43].
Thus, the whole (of) {DK} is equal to the gnomon {UVW} and {NO}.
Therefore, since the whole (of) {AK} is equal to {LM} and {NO}, of which {DK} is equal to the gnomon {UVW} and {NO}, the remainder {AB} is thus equal to {TS}.
And {TS} is the (square) on {LN}.
Thus, the (square) on {LN} is equal to the area {AB}.
{LN} is thus the square-root of area {AB}.
[So], I say that {LN} is the first apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For since {EK} is a rational (area), and is equal to {LO}, {LO}---that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by {LP} and {PN}---is thus a rational (area).
And {NO} was shown (to be) a medial (area).
Thus, {LO} is incommensurable with {NO}.
And as {LO} (is) to {NO}, so {LP} is to {PN} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {LP} and {PN} are incommensurable in length [Prop. 10.11].
{LP} and {PN} are thus medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and which contain a rational (area).
Thus, {LN} is the first apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.74].
And it is the square-root of area {AB}.

Thus, the square root of area {AB} is the first apotome of a medial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
