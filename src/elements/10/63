The square on a major (straight-line) applied to a rational (straight-line) produces as breadth a fourth binomial (straight-line).

Let {AB} be a major (straight-line) having been divided at {C}, such that {AC} is greater than {CB}, and (let) {DE} (be) a rational (straight-line).
And let the parallelogram {DF}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {DE}, producing {DG} as breadth.
I say that {DG} is a fourth binomial (straight-line).

Let the same construction be made as that shown previously.
And since {AB} is a major (straight-line), having been divided at {C}, {AC} and {CB} are incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them rational, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial [Prop. 10.39].
Therefore, since the sum of the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is rational, {DL} is thus rational.
Thus, {DM} (is) also rational, and commensurable in length with {DE} [Prop. 10.20].
Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}---that is to say, {MF}---is medial, and is (applied to) the rational (straight-line) {ML}, {MG} is thus also rational, and incommensurable in length with {DE} [Prop. 10.22].
{DM} is thus also incommensurable in length with {MG} [Prop. 10.13].
{DM} and {MG} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {DG} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
[So] we must show that (it is) also a fourth (binomial straight-line).

So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can show that {DM} is greater than {MG}, and that the (rectangle contained) by {DKM} is equal to the (square) on {MN}.
Therefore, since the (square) on {AC} is incommensurable with the (square) on {CB}, {DH} is also incommensurable with {KL}.
Hence, {DK} is also incommensurable with {KM} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And if there are two unequal straight-lines, and a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) incommensurable (in length), then the square on the greater will be larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with the greater [Prop. 10.18].
Thus, the square on {DM} is greater than (the square on) {MG} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({DM}).
And {DM} and {MG} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And {DM} is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {DE}.

Thus, {DG} is a fourth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.8].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
