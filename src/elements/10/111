An apotome is not the same as a binomial.

Let {AB} be an apotome.
I say that {AB} is not the same as a binomial.

For, if possible, let it be (the same).
And let a rational (straight-line) {DC} be laid down.
And let the rectangle {CE}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {CD}, producing {DE} as breadth.
Therefore, since {AB} is an apotome, {DE} is a first apotome [Prop. 10.97].
Let {EF} be an attachment to it.
Thus, {DF} and {FE} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {DF} is greater than (the square on) {FE} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DF}), and {DF} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {DC} [Def. 10.10].
Again, since {AB} is a binomial, {DE} is thus a first binomial [Prop. 10.60].
Let ({DE}) have been divided into its (component) terms at {G}, and let {DG} be the greater term.
Thus, {DG} and {GE} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {DG} is greater than (the square on) {GE} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DG}), and the greater (term) {DG} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {DC} [Def. 10.5].
Thus, {DF} is also commensurable in length with {DG} [Prop. 10.12].
The remainder {GF} is thus commensurable in length with {DF} [Prop. 10.15].
[Therefore, since {DF} is commensurable with {GF}, and {DF} is rational, {GF} is thus also rational.
Therefore, since {DF} is commensurable in length with {GF},] {DF} (is) incommensurable in length with {EF}.
Thus, {FG} is also incommensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.13].
{GF} and {FE} [are] thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EG} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
But, (it is) also rational.
The very thing is impossible.

Thus, an apotome is not the same as a binomial.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

[Corollary]

The apotome and the irrational (straight-lines) after it are neither the same as a medial (straight-line) nor (the same) as one another.

For the (square) on a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a rational (straight-line which is) incommensurable in length with the (straight-line) to which (the area) is applied [Prop. 10.22].
And the (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a first apotome [Prop. 10.97].
And the (square) on a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a second apotome [Prop. 10.98].
And the (square) on a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a third apotome [Prop. 10.99].
And (square) on a minor (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a fourth apotome [Prop. 10.100].
And (square) on that (straight-line) which with a rational (area) produces a medial whole, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a fifth apotome [Prop. 10.101].
And (square) on that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) produces a medial whole, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a sixth apotome [Prop. 10.102].
Therefore, since the aforementioned breadths differ from the first (breadth), and from one another---from the first, because it is rational, and from one another since they are not the same in order---clearly, the irrational (straight-lines) themselves also differ from one another.
And since it has been shown that an apotome is not the same as a binomial [Prop. 10.111], and (that) the (irrational straight-lines) after the apotome, being applied to a rational (straight-line), produce as breadth, each according to its own (order), apotomes, and (that) the (irrational straight-lines) after the binomial themselves also (produce as breadth), according (to their) order, binomials, the (irrational straight-lines) after the apotome are thus different, and the (irrational straight-lines) after the binomial (are also) different, so that there are, in order, 13 irrational (straight-lines) in all:
Medial,
Binomial,
First bimedial,
Second bimedial,
Major,
Square-root of a rational plus a medial (area),
Square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas),
Apotome,
First apotome of a medial,
Second apotome of a medial,
Minor,
That which with a rational (area) produces a medial whole,
That which with a medial (area) produces a medial whole.
