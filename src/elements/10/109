A rational (area) being subtracted from a medial (area), two other irrational (straight-lines) arise (as the square-root of the remaining area)---either a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), or that (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole.

For let the rational (area) {BD polygon} have been subtracted from the medial (area) {BC polygon}.
I say that one of two irrational (straight-lines) arise (as) the square-root of the remaining (area), {EC polygon}---either a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), or that (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole.

For let the rational (straight-line) {FG line} be laid down, and let similar areas (to the preceding proposition) have been applied (to it).
So, accordingly, {FH line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {FG line}, and {KF line} (is) also rational, and commensurable in length with {FG line}.
Thus, {FH line} and {FK line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.13].
{KH line} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73], and {FK line} an attachment to it.
So, the square on {HF line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({HF line}), or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length with {HF line}).

Therefore, if the square on {HF line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({HF line}), and (since) the attachment {FK line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {FG line}, {KH line} is a second apotome [Def. 10.12].
And {FG line} (is) rational.
Hence, the square-root of {LH polygon}---that is to say, (of) {EC polygon}---is a first apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.92].

And if the square on {HF line} is greater than (the square on) {FK line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length with {HF line}), and (since) the attachment {FK line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {FG line}, {KH line} is a fifth apotome [Def. 10.15].
Hence, the square-root of {EC polygon} is that (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole [Prop. 10.95].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
