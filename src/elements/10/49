To find a second binomial (straight-line).

Let the two numbers {AC} and {CB} be laid down such that their sum {AB} has to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, and does not have to {AC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
And let the rational (straight-line) {D} be laid down.
And let {EF} be commensurable in length with {D}.
{EF} is thus a rational (straight-line).
So, let it also have been contrived that as the number {CA} (is) to {AB}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {EF} is commensurable with the (square) on FG [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, {FG} is also a rational (straight-line).
And since the number {CA} does not have to {AB} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {EF} does not have to the (square) on {FG} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF} is incommensurable in length with {FG} [Prop. 10.9].
{EF} and {FG} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EG} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, we must show that (it is) also a second (binomial straight-line).

For since, inversely, as the number {BA} is to {AC}, so the (square) on {GF} (is) to the (square) on {FE} [Prop. 5.7 corr.], and {BA} (is) greater than {AC}, the (square) on {GF} (is) thus [also] greater than the (square) on {FE} [Prop. 5.14].
Let (the sum of) the (squares) on {EF} and {H} be equal to the (square) on {GF}.
Thus, via conversion, as {AB} is to {BC}, so the (square) on {FG} (is) to the (square) on {H} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
But, {AB} has to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {FG} also has to the (square) on {H} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, {FG} is commensurable in length with {H} [Prop. 10.9].
Hence, the square on {FG} is greater than (the square on) {FE} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({FG}).
And {FG} and {FE} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And the lesser term {EF} is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line) {D} (previously) laid down.

Thus, {EG} is a second binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.6].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
