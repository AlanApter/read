If a straight-line, which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them rational, is subtracted from a(nother) straight-line then the remainder is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called that which makes with a rational (area) a medial whole.

For let the straight-line {BC}, which is incommensurable in square with {AB}, and fulfils the (other) prescribed (conditions), have been subtracted from the straight-line {AB} [Prop. 10.34].
I say that the remainder {AC} is the aforementioned irrational (straight-line).

For since the sum of the squares on {AB} and {BC} is medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} rational, the (sum of the squares) on {AB} and {BC} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC}.
Thus, the remaining (square) on {AC} is also incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} [Props. 2.7, 10.16].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} is rational.
Thus, the (square) on {AC} is irrational.
Thus, {AC} is an irrational (straight-line) [Def. 10.4].
And let it be called that which makes with a rational (area) a medial whole.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
