To find a third apotome.

Let the rational (straight-line) {A magnitude} be laid down.
And let the three numbers, {E magnitude}, {BC magnitude}, and {CD magnitude}, not having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, be laid down.
And let {CB magnitude} have to {BD magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let it have been contrived that as {E magnitude} (is) to {BC magnitude}, so the square on {A magnitude} (is) to the square on {FG magnitude}, and as {BC magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude}, so the square on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Therefore, since as {E magnitude} is to {BC magnitude}, so the square on {A magnitude} (is) to the square on {FG magnitude}, the square on {A magnitude} is thus commensurable with the square on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And the square on {A magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) also rational.
Thus, {FG magnitude} is a rational (straight-line).
And since {E magnitude} does not have to {BC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the square on {A magnitude} thus does not have to the [square] on {FG magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {A magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Again, since as {BC magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, so the square on {FG magnitude} is to the (square) on {GH magnitude}, the square on {FG magnitude} is thus commensurable with the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {GH magnitude} (is) also rational.
Thus, {GH magnitude} is a rational (straight-line).
And since {BC magnitude} does not have to {CD magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {FG magnitude} thus does not have to the (square) on {GH magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {FG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And both are rational (straight-lines).
{FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {FH magnitude} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a third (apotome).

For since as {E magnitude} is to {BC magnitude}, so the square on {A magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude}, and as {BC magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {HG magnitude}, thus, via equality, as {E magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, so the (square) on {A magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {HG magnitude} [Prop. 5.22].
And {E magnitude} does not have to {CD magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {A magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {GH magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
{A magnitude} (is) thus incommensurable in length with {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, neither of {FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {A magnitude}.
Therefore, let the (square) on {K magnitude} be that (area) by which the (square) on {FG magnitude} is greater than the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.13 lem.].
Therefore, since as {BC magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude}, thus, via conversion, as {BC magnitude} is to {BD magnitude}, so the square on {FG magnitude} (is) to the square on {K magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {BC magnitude} has to {BD magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {FG magnitude} also has to the (square) on {K magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
{FG magnitude} is thus commensurable in length with {K magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And the square on {FG magnitude} is (thus) greater than (the square on) {GH magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({FG magnitude}).
And neither of {FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {A magnitude}.
Thus, {FH magnitude} is a third apotome [Def. 10.13].

Thus, the third apotome {FH magnitude} has been found.
(Which is) very thing it was required to show.
