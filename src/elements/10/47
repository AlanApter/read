The square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) can be divided (into its component terms) at one point only.

Let {AB} be [the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas)] which has been divided at {C}, such that {AC} and {CB} are incommensurable in square, making the sum of the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} medial, and the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} medial, and, moreover, incommensurable with the sum of the (squares) on ({AC} and {CB}) [Prop. 10.41].
I say that {AB} cannot be divided at another point fulfilling the prescribed (conditions).

For, if possible, let it have been divided at {D}, such that {AC} is again manifestly not the same as {DB}, but {AC} (is), by hypothesis, greater.
And let the rational (straight-line) {EF} be laid down.
And let {EG}, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB}, and {HK}, equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}, have been applied to {EF}.
Thus, the whole of {EK} is equal to the square on {AB} [Prop. 2.4].
So, again, let {EL}, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD} and {DB}, have been applied to {EF}.
Thus, the remainder---twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB}---is equal to the remainder, {MK}.
And since the sum of the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} was assumed (to be) medial, {EG} is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}.
{HE} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.22].
So, for the same (reasons), {HN} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF}.
And since the sum of the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}, {EG} is thus also incommensurable with {GN}.
Hence, {EH} is also incommensurable with {HN} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And they are (both) rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {EH} and {HN} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {EN} is a binomial (straightline) which has been divided (into its component terms) at {H} [Prop. 10.36].
So, similarly, we can show that it has also been (so) divided at {M}.
And {EH} is not the same as {MN}.
Thus, a binomial (straight-line) has been divided (into its component terms) at different points.
The very thing is absurd [Prop. 10.42].
Thus, the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) cannot be divided (into its component terms) at different points.
Thus, it can be (so) divided at one [point] only.
