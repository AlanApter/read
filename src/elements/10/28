To find (two) medial (straight-lines), containing a medial (area), (which are) commensurable in square only.

Let the [three] rational (straight-lines) {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid down.
And let, {D magnitude}, the mean proportional (straight-line) to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, have been taken [Prop. 6.13].
And let it be contrived that as {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, (so) {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 6.12].

Since the rational (straight-lines) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are commensurable in square only, the (rectangle contained) by {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}---that is to say, the (square) on {D magnitude} [Prop. 6.17]---is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, {D magnitude} (is) medial [Prop. 10.21].
And since {B magnitude} and {C magnitude} are commensurable in square only, and as {B magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, (so) {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} are thus commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].
And {D magnitude} (is) medial.
{E magnitude} (is) thus also medial [Prop. 10.23].
Thus, {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
So, I say that they also enclose a medial (area).
For since as {B magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, (so) {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, thus, alternately, as {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, (so) {C magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].
And as {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, (so) {D magnitude} (is) to {A magnitude}.
And thus as {D magnitude} (is) to {A magnitude}, (so) {C magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {A magnitude} and {C magnitude} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} [Prop. 6.16].
And the (rectangle contained) by {A magnitude} and {C magnitude} is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} (is) also medial.

Thus, (two) medial (straight-lines, {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}), containing a medial (area), (which are) commensurable in square only, have been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
