When a rational and a medial (area) are added together, four irrational (straight-lines) arise (as the square-roots of the total area)---either a binomial, or a first bimedial, or a major, or the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).

Let {AB} be a rational (area), and {CD} a medial (area).
I say that the square-root of area {AD} is either binomial, or first bimedial, or major, or the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).

For {AB} is either greater or less than {CD}.
Let it, first of all, be greater.
And let the rational (straight-line) {EF} be laid down.
And let (the rectangle) {EG}, equal to {AB}, have been applied to {EF}, producing {EH} as breadth.
And let (the recatangle) {HI}, equal to {DC}, have been applied to {EF}, producing {HK} as breadth.
And since {AB} is rational, and is equal to {EG}, {EG} is thus also rational.
And it has been applied to the [rational] (straight-line) {EF}, producing {EH} as breadth.
{EH} is thus rational, and commensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.20].
Again, since {CD} is medial, and is equal to {HI}, {HI} is thus also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}, producing {HK} as breadth.
{HK} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {CD} is medial, and {AB} rational, {AB} is thus incommensurable with {CD}.
Hence, {EG} is also incommensurable with {HI}.
And as {EG} (is) to {HI}, so {EH} is to {HK} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EH} is also incommensurable in length with {HK} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational.
Thus, {EH} and {HK} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{EK} is thus a binomial (straight-line), having been divided (into its component terms) at {H} [Prop. 10.36].
And since {AB} is greater than {CD}, and {AB} (is) equal to {EG}, and {CD} to {HI}, {EG} (is) thus also greater than {HI}.
Thus, {EH} is also greater than {HK} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, the square on {EH} is greater than (the square on) {HK} either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({EH}), or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length with {EH}).
Let it, first of all, be greater by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length with {EH}).
And the greater (of the two components of {EK}) {HE} is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down (straight-line) {EF}.
{EK} is thus a first binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.5].
And {EF} (is) rational.
And if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.54].
Thus, the square-root of {EI} is a binomial (straight-line).
Hence the square-root of {AD} is also a binomial (straight-line).
And, so, let the square on {EH} be greater than (the square on) {HK} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({EH}).
And the greater (of the two components of {EK}) {EH} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {EF}.
Thus, {EK} is a fourth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.8].
And {EF} (is) rational.
And if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line) called major [Prop. 10.57].
Thus, the square-root of area {EI} is a major (straight-line). Hence, the square-root of {AD} is also major.

And so, let {AB} be less than {CD}.
Thus, {EG} is also less than {HI}.
Hence, {EH} is also less than {HK} [Props. 6.1, 5.14].
And the square on {HK} is greater than (the square on) {EH} either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({HK}), or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({HK}).
Let it, first of all, be greater by the square on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({HK}).
And the lesser (of the two components of {EK}) {EH} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {EF}.
Thus, {EK} is a second binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.6].
And {EF} (is) rational.
And if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a second binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is a first bimedial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.55].
Thus, the square-root of area {EI} is a first bimedial (straight-line).
Hence, the square-root of {AD} is also a first bimedial (straight-line).
And so, let the square on {HK} be greater than (the square on) {HE} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({HK}).
And the lesser (of the two components of {EK}) {EH} is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {EF}.
Thus, {EK} is a fifth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.9].
And {EF} (is) rational.
And if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fifth binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area) [Prop. 10.58].
Thus, the square-root of area {EI} is the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).
Hence, the square-root of area {AD} is also the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).

Thus, when a rational and a medial area are added together, four irrational (straight-lines) arise (as the square-roots of the total area)---either a binomial, or a first bimedial, or a major, or the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
