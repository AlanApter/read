A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with a major (straight-line) is itself also major.

Let {AB magnitude} be a major (straight-line), and let {CD magnitude} be commensurable (in length) with {AB magnitude}.
I say that {CD magnitude} is a major (straight-line).

Let {AB magnitude} have been divided (into its component terms) at {E point}.
{AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are thus incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them rational, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial [Prop. 10.39].
And let (the) same (things) have been contrived as in the previous (propositions).
And since as {AB magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, so {AE magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude} and {EB magnitude} to {FD magnitude}, thus also as {AE magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude}, so {EB magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].
And {AB magnitude} (is) commensurable (in length) with {CD magnitude}.
Thus, {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (are) also commensurable (in length) with {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}, respectively [Prop. 10.11].
And since as {AE magnitude} is to {CF magnitude}, so {EB magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}, also, alternately, as {AE magnitude} (is) to {EB magnitude}, so {CF magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.16], and thus, via composition, as {AB magnitude} is to {BE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} (is) to {DF magnitude} [Prop. 5.18].
And thus as the (square) on {AB magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {BE magnitude}, so the (square) on {CD magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {DF magnitude} [Prop. 6.20].
So, similarly, we can also show that as the (square) on {AB magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {AE magnitude}, so the (square) on {CD magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {CF magnitude}.
And thus as the (square) on {AB magnitude} (is) to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude}, so the (square) on {CD magnitude} (is) to (the sum of) the (squares) on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}.
And thus, alternately, as the (square) on {AB magnitude} is to the (square) on {CD magnitude}, so (the sum of) the (squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (is) to (the sum of) the (squares) on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].
And the (square) on {AB magnitude} (is) commensurable with the (square) on {CD magnitude}.
Thus, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (is) also commensurable with (the sum of) the (squares) on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
And the (squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (added) together are rational.
The (squares) on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} (added) together (are) thus also rational.
So, similarly, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is also commensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}.
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} is medial.
Therefore, twice the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
{CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are thus (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square [Prop 10.13], simultaneously making the sum of the squares on them rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them medial.
The whole, {CD magnitude}, is thus that irrational (straight-line) called major [Prop. 10.39].

Thus, a (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with a major (straight-line) is major.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
