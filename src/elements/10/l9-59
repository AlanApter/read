If a straight-line is cut unequally then (the sum of) the squares on the unequal (parts) is greater than twice the rectangle contained by the unequal (parts).

Let {AB} be a straight-line, and let it have been cut unequally at {C}, and let {AC} be greater (than {CB}).
I say that (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}.

For let {AB} have been cut in half at {D}.
Therefore, since a straight-line has been cut into equal (parts) at {D}, and into unequal (parts) at {C}, the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}, plus the (square) on {CD}, is thus equal to the (square) on {AD} [Prop. 2.5].
Hence, the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is less than the (square) on {AD}.
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is less than double the (square) on {AD}.
But, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} [is] double (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD} and {DC} [Prop. 2.9].
Thus, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
