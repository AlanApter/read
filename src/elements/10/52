To find a fifth binomial straight-line.

Let the two numbers {AC} and {CB} be laid down such that {AB} does not have to either of them the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let some rational straight-line {D} be laid down.
And let {EF} be commensurable [in length] with {D}.
Thus, {EF} (is) a rational (straight-line).
And let it have been contrived that as {CA} (is) to {AB}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
And {CA} does not have to {AB} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {EF} does not have to the (square) on {FG} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {EF} and {FG} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, {EG} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that (it is) also a fifth (binomial straight-line).

For since as {CA} is to {AB}, so the (square) on {EF} (is) to the (square) on {FG}, inversely, as {BA} (is) to {AC}, so the (square) on {FG} (is) to the (square) on {FE} [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {GF} (is) greater than the (square) on {FE} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on {EF} and {H} be equal to the (square) on {GF}.
Thus, via conversion, as the number {AB} is to {BC}, so the (square) on {GF} (is) to the (square) on {H} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {AB} does not have to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {FG} does not have to the (square) on {H} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {FG} is incommensurable in length with {H} [Prop. 10.9].
Hence, the square on {FG} is greater than (the square on) {FE} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({FG}).
And {GF} and {FE} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And the lesser term {EF} is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line previously) laid down, {D}.

Thus, {EG} is a fifth binomial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
