Only one straight-line, which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and (together) with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them rational, can be attached to that (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole.

Let {AB magnitude} be a (straight-line) which with a rational (area) makes a medial whole, and let {BC magnitude} be (so) attached to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, fulfilling the (other) proscribed (conditions) [Prop. 10.77].
I say that another (straight-line) fulfilling the same (conditions) cannot be attached to {AB magnitude}.

For, if possible, let {BD magnitude} be (so) attached (to {AB magnitude}).
Thus, {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are also straight-lines (which are) incommensurable in square, fulfilling the (other) prescribed (conditions) [Prop. 10.77].
Therefore, analogously to the (propositions) before this, since by whatever (area) the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} also exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by this (same area).
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} exceeds twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area).
For they are (both) rational (areas).
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} also exceeds the (sum of the squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} by a rational (area).
The very thing is impossible.
For both are medial (areas) [Prop. 10.26].

Thus, another straight-line cannot be attached to {AB magnitude}, which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and fulfills the (other) aforementioned (conditions) with the whole.
Thus, only one (such straight-line) can be (so) attached.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
