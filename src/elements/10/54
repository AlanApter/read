If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called binomial.

For let the area {AC} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB} and by the first binomial (straight-line) {AD}.
I say that square-root of area {AC} is the irrational (straight-line which is) called binomial.

For since {AD} is a first binomial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at {E}, and let {AE} be the greater term.
So, (it is) clear that {AE} and {ED} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and that the square on {AE} is greater than (the square on) {ED} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE}), and that {AE} is commensurable (in length) with the rational (straight-line) {AB} (first) laid out [Def. 10.5].
So, let {ED} have been cut in half at point {F}.
And since the square on {AE} is greater than (the square on) {ED} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE}), thus if a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser (term)---that is to say, the (square) on {EF}---falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater (term) {AE}, then it divides it into (terms which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop 10.17].
Therefore, let the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GE}, equal to the (square) on {EF}, have been applied to {AE}.
{AG} is thus commensurable in length with {EG}.
And let {GH}, {EK}, and {FL} have been drawn from (points) {G}, {E}, and {F} (respectively), parallel to either of {AB} or {CD}.
And let the square {SN}, equal to the parallelogram {AH}, have been constructed, and (the square) {NQ}, equal to (the parallelogram) {GK} [Prop. 2.14].
And let {MN} be laid down so as to be straight-on to {NO}.
{RN} is thus also straight-on to {NP}.
And let the parallelogram {SQ} have been completed.
{SQ} is thus a square [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GE} is equal to the (square) on {EF}, thus as {AG} is to {EF}, so {FE} (is) to {EG} [Prop. 6.17].
And thus as {AH} (is) to {EL}, (so) {EL} (is) to {KG} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EL} is the mean proportional to {AH} and {GK}.
But, {AH} is equal to {SN}, and {GK} (is) equal to {NQ}.
{EL} is thus the mean proportional to {SN} and {NQ}.
And {MR} is also the mean proportional to the same---(namely), {SN} and {NQ} [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
{EL} is thus equal to {MR}.
Hence, it is also equal to {PO} [Prop. 1.43].
And {AH} plus {GK} is equal to {SN} plus {NQ}.
Thus, the whole of {AC} is equal to the whole of {SQ}---that is to say, to the square on {MO}.
Thus, {MO} (is) the square-root of (area) {AC}.
I say that {MO} is a binomial (straight-line).

For since {AG} is commensurable (in length) with {GE}, {AE} is also commensurable (in length) with each of {AG} and {GE} [Prop. 10.15].
And {AE} was also assumed (to be) commensurable (in length) with {AB}.
Thus, {AG} and {GE} are also commensurable (in length) with {AB} [Prop. 10.12].
And {AB} is rational.
{AG} and {GE} are thus each also rational.
Thus, {AH} and {GK} are each rational (areas), and {AH} is commensurable with {GK} [Prop. 10.19].
But, {AH} is equal to {SN}, and {GK} to {NQ}.
{SN} and {NQ}---that is to say, the (squares) on {MN} and {NO} (respectively)---are thus also rational and commensurable.
And since {AE} is incommensurable in length with {ED}, but {AE} is commensurable (in length) with {AG}, and {DE} (is) commensurable (in length) with {EF}, {AG} (is) thus also incommensurable (in length) with {EF} [Prop. 10.13].
Hence, {AH} is also incommensurable with {EL} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
But, {AH} is equal to {SN}, and {EL} to {MR}.
Thus, {SN} is also incommensurable with {MR}.
But, as {SN} (is) to {MR}, (so) {PN} (is) to {NR} [Prop. 6.1].
{PN} is thus incommensurable (in length) with {NR} [Prop. 10.11].
And {PN} (is) equal to {MN}, and {NR} to {NO}.
Thus, {MN} is incommensurable (in length) with {NO}.
And the (square) on {MN} is commensurable with the (square) on {NO}, and each (is) rational.
{MN} and {NO} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.

Thus, {MO} is (both) a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36], and the square-root of {AC}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
