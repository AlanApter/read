A (straight-line) commensurable in length with a bimedial (straight-line) is itself also bimedial, and the same in order.

Let {AB} be a bimedial (straight-line), and let {CD} be commensurable in length with {AB}.
I say that {CD} is bimedial, and the same in order as {AB}.

For since {AB} is a bimedial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) medial (straight-lines) at {E}.
Thus, {AE} and {EB} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Props. 10.37, 10.38].
And let it have been contrived that as {AB} (is) to {CD}, (so) {AE} (is) to {CF} [Prop. 6.12].
And thus as the remainder {EB} is to the remainder {FD}, so {AB} (is) to {CD} [Props. 5.19 corr., 6.16].
And {AB} (is) commensurable in length with {CD}.
Thus, {AE} and {EB} are also commensurable (in length) with {CF} and {FD}, respectively [Prop. 10.11].
And {AE} and {EB} (are) medial.
Thus, {CF} and {FD} (are) also medial [Prop. 10.23].
And since as {AE} is to {EB}, (so) {CF} (is) to {FD}, and {AE} and {EB} are commensurable in square only, {CF} and {FD} are [thus] also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].
And they were also shown (to be) medial.
Thus, {CD} is a bimedial (straight-line).
So, I say that it is also the same in order as {AB}.

For since as {AE} is to {EB}, (so) {CF} (is) to {FD}, thus also as the (square) on {AE} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {AEB}, so the (square) on {CF} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CFD} [Prop. 10.21 lem.].
Alternately, as the (square) on {AE} (is) to the (square) on {CF}, so the (rectangle contained) by {AEB} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {CFD} [Prop. 5.16].
And the (square) on {AE} (is) commensurable with the (square) on {CF}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AEB} (is) also commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {CFD} [Prop. 10.11].
Therefore, either the (rectangle contained) by {AEB} is rational, and the (rectangle contained) by {CFD} is rational [and, on account of this, ({AE} and {CD}) are first bimedial (straight-lines)], or (the rectangle contained by {AEB} is) medial, and (the rectangle contained by {CFD} is) medial, and ({AB} and {CD}) are each second (bimedial straight-lines) [Props. 10.23, 10.37, 10.38].

And, on account of this, {CD} will be the same in order as {AB}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
