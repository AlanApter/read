To find a third binomial (straight-line).

Let the two numbers {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} be laid down such that their sum {AB magnitude} has to {BC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, and does not have to {AC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let some other non-square number {D magnitude} also be laid down, and let it not have to each of {BA magnitude} and {AC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let some rational straight-line {E magnitude} be laid down, and let it have been contrived that as {D magnitude} (is) to {AB magnitude}, so the (square) on {E magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {E magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And {E magnitude} is a rational (straight-line).
Thus, {FG magnitude} is also a rational (straight-line).
And since {D magnitude} does not have to {AB magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number has to (some) square number, the (square) on {E magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {FG magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
{E magnitude} is thus incommensurable in length with {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
So, again, let it have been contrived that as the number {BA magnitude} (is) to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {FG magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And {FG magnitude} (is) a rational (straight-line).
Thus, {GH magnitude} (is) also a rational (straight-line).
And since {BA magnitude} does not have to {AC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {FG magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {HG magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {FG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
{FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {FH magnitude} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that (it is) also a third (binomial straight-line).

For since as {D magnitude} is to {AB magnitude}, so the (square) on {E magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude}, and as {BA magnitude} (is) to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude}, thus, via equality, as {D magnitude} (is) to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {E magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 5.22].
And {D magnitude} does not have to {AC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {E magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {GH magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {E magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And since as {BA magnitude} is to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude}, the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) thus greater than the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on {GH magnitude} and {K magnitude} be equal to the (square) on {FG magnitude}.
Thus, via conversion, as {AB magnitude} [is] to {BC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {K magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {AB magnitude} has to {BC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {FG magnitude} also has to the (square) on {K magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, {FG magnitude} [is] commensurable in length with {K magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, the square on {FG magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GH magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({FG magnitude}).
And {FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with {E magnitude}.

Thus, {FH magnitude} is a third binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.7].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
