To find a third binomial (straight-line).

Let the two numbers {AC} and {CB} be laid down such that their sum {AB} has to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, and does not have to {AC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let some other non-square number {D} also be laid down, and let it not have to each of {BA} and {AC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let some rational straight-line {E} be laid down, and let it have been contrived that as {D} (is) to {AB}, so the (square) on {E} (is) to the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {E} is commensurable with the (square) on {FG} [Prop. 10.6].
And {E} is a rational (straight-line).
Thus, {FG} is also a rational (straight-line).
And since {D} does not have to {AB} the ratio which (some) square number has to (some) square number, the (square) on {E} does not have to the (square) on {FG} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
{E} is thus incommensurable in length with {FG} [Prop. 10.9].
So, again, let it have been contrived that as the number {BA} (is) to {AC}, so the (square) on {FG} (is) to the (square) on {GH} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {FG} is commensurable with the (square) on {GH} [Prop. 10.6].
And {FG} (is) a rational (straight-line).
Thus, {GH} (is) also a rational (straight-line).
And since {BA} does not have to {AC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {FG} does not have to the (square) on {HG} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {FG} is incommensurable in length with {GH} [Prop. 10.9].
{FG} and {GH} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {FH} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, I say that (it is) also a third (binomial straight-line).

For since as {D} is to {AB}, so the (square) on {E} (is) to the (square) on {FG}, and as {BA} (is) to {AC}, so the (square) on {FG} (is) to the (square) on {GH}, thus, via equality, as {D} (is) to {AC}, so the (square) on {E} (is) to the (square) on {GH} [Prop. 5.22].
And {D} does not have to {AC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {E} does not have to the (square) on {GH} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {E} is incommensurable in length with {GH} [Prop. 10.9].
And since as {BA} is to {AC}, so the (square) on {FG} (is) to the (square) on {GH}, the (square) on {FG} (is) thus greater than the (square) on {GH} [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on {GH} and {K} be equal to the (square) on {FG}.
Thus, via conversion, as {AB} [is] to {BC}, so the (square) on {FG} (is) to the (square) on {K} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {AB} has to {BC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {FG} also has to the (square) on {K} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, {FG} [is] commensurable in length with {K} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, the square on {FG} is greater than (the square on) {GH} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({FG}).
And {FG} and {GH} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with {E}.

Thus, {FH} is a third binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.7].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
