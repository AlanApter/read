A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) is (itself also) the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

Let {AB magnitude} be the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas), and (let) {CD magnitude} (be) commensurable (in length) with {AB magnitude}.
We must show that {CD magnitude} is also the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

For since {AB magnitude} is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas), let it have been divided into its (component) straight-lines at {E point}.
Thus, {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} are incommensurable in square, making the sum of the [squares] on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial, and, moreover, the sum of the (squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} incommensurable with the (rectangle) contained by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} [Prop. 10.41].
And let the same construction have been made as in the previous (propositions).
So, similarly, we can show that {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} are also incommensurable in square, and (that) the sum of the (squares) on {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (is) commensurable with the sum of the (squares) on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}, and the (rectangle contained) by {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} with the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}.
Hence, the sum of the squares on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} is also medial, and the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} (is) medial, and, moreover, the sum of the squares on {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude} (is) incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {CF magnitude} and {FD magnitude}.

Thus, {CD magnitude} is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) [Prop. 10.41].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
