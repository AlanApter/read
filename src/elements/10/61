The square on a first bimedial (straight-line) applied to a rational (straight-line) produces as breadth a second binomial (straight-line).

Let {AB} be a first bimedial (straight-line) having been divided into its (component) medial (straight-lines) at {C}, of which {AC} (is) the greater.
And let the rational (straight-line) {DE} be laid down.
And let the parallelogram {DF}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {DE}, producing {DG} as breadth.
I say that {DG} is a second binomial (straight-line).

For let the same construction have been made as in the (proposition) before this.
And since {AB} is a first bimedial (straight-line), having been divided at {C}, {AC} and {CB} are thus medial (straight-lines) commensurable in square only, and containing a rational (area) [Prop. 10.37].
Hence, the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} are also medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, {DL} is medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {DE}.
{MD} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {DE} [Prop. 10.22].
Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is rational, {MF} is also rational.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {ML}.
Thus, {MG} [is] also rational, and commensurable in length with {ML}---that is to say, with {DE} [Prop. 10.20].
{DM} is thus incommensurable in length with {MG} [Prop. 10.13].
And they are rational.
{DM} and {MG} are thus rational, and commensurable in square only.
{DG} is thus a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, we must show that (it is) also a second (binomial straight-line).

For since (the sum of) the squares on {AC} and {CB} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.59], {DL} (is) thus also greater than {MF}.
Hence, {DM} (is) also (greater) than {MG} [Prop. 6.1].
And since the (square) on {AC} is commensurable with the (square) on {CB}, {DH} is also commensurable with {KL}.
Hence, {DK} is also commensurable (in length) with {KM} [Props.
6.1, 10.11].
And the (rectangle contained) by {DKM} is equal to the (square) on {MN}.
Thus, the square on {DM} is greater than (the square on) {MG} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DM}) [Prop.
10.17].
And {MG} is commensurable in length with {DE}.

Thus, {DG} is a second binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.6].
