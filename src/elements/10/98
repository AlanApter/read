The (square) on a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a second apotome as breadth.

Let {AB} be a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), and {CD} a rational (straight-line).
And let {CE}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {CD}, producing {CF} as breadth.
I say that {CF} is a second apotome.

For let {BG} be an attachment to {AB}.
Thus, {AG} and {GB} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a rational (area) [Prop. 10.74].
And let {CH}, equal to the (square) on {AG}, have been applied to {CD}, producing {CK} as breadth, and {KL}, equal to the (square) on {GB}, producing {KM} as breadth.
Thus, the whole of {CL} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}.
Thus, {CL} (is) also a medial (area) [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD}, producing {CM} as breadth.
{CM} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {CL} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}, of which the (square) on {AB} is equal to {CE}, the remainder, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}, is thus equal to {FL} [Prop. 2.7].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} [is] rational.
Thus, {FL} (is) rational.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {FE}, producing {FM} as breadth.
{FM} is thus also rational, and commensurable in length with {CD} [Prop. 10.20].
Therefore, since the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}---that is to say, {CL}---is medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}---that is to say, {FL}---(is) rational, {CL} is thus incommensurable with {FL}.
And as {CL} (is) to {FL}, so {CM} is to {FM} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {CM} (is) incommensurable in length with {FM} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {CM} and {MF} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a second (apotome).

For let {FM} have been cut in half at {N}.
And let {NO} have been drawn through (point) {N}, parallel to {CD}.
Thus, {FO} and {NL} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}.
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} is the mean proportional to the squares on {AG} and {GB} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and the (square) on {AG} is equal to {CH}, and the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} to {NL}, and the (square) on {BG} to {KL}, {NL} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH} and {KL}.
Thus, as {CH} is to {NL}, so {NL} (is) to {KL} [Prop. 5.11].
But, as {CH} (is) to {NL}, so {CK} is to {NM}, and as {NL} (is) to {KL}, so {NM} is to {MK} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, as {CK} (is) to {NM}, so {NM} is to {KM} [Prop. 5.11].
The (rectangle contained) by {CK} and {KM} is thus equal to the (square) on {NM} [Prop. 6.17]---that is to say, to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM} [and since the (square) on {AG} is commensurable with the (square) on {BG}, {CH} is also commensurable with {KL}---that is to say, {CK} with {KM}].
Therefore, since {CM} and {MF} are two unequal straight-lines, and the (rectangle contained) by {CK} and {KM}, equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {MF}, has been applied to the greater {CM}, falling short by a square figure, and divides it into commensurable (parts), the square on {CM} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({CM}) [Prop. 10.17].
The attachment {FM} is also commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD}.
{CF} is thus a second apotome [Def. 10.16].

Thus, the (square) on a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a second apotome as breadth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
