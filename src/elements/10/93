If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a third apotome then the square-root of the area is a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For let the area {AB} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC} and the third apotome {AD}.
I say that the square-root of area {AB} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For let {DG} be an attachment to {AD}.
Thus, {AG} and {GD} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73], and neither of {AG} and {GD} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC}, and the square on the whole, {AG}, is greater than (the square on) the attachment, {DG}, by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AG}) [Def. 10.13].
Therefore, since the square on {AG} is greater than (the square on) {GD} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AG}), thus if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the square on {DG} is applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG}) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].
Therefore, let {DG} have been cut in half at {E}.
And let (an area) equal to the (square) on {EG} have been applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure.
And let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF} and {FG}.
And let {EH}, {FI}, and {GK} have been drawn through points {E}, {F}, and {G} (respectively), parallel to {AC}.
Thus, {AF} and {FG} are commensurable (in length).
{AI} (is) thus also commensurable with {FK} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And since {AF} and {FG} are commensurable in length, {AG} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {AF} and {FG} [Prop. 10.15].
And {AG} (is) rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC}.
Hence, {AF} and {FG} (are) also (rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC}) [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {AI} and {FK} are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].
Again, since {DE} is commensurable in length with {EG}, {DG} is also commensurable in length with each of {DE} and {EG} [Prop. 10.15].
And {GD} (is) rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC}.
Thus, {DE} and {EG} (are) each also rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC} [Prop. 10.13].
{DH} and {EK} are thus each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].
And since {AG} and {GD} are commensurable in square only, {AG} is thus incommensurable in length with {GD}.
But, {AG} is commensurable in length with {AF}, and {DG} with {EG}.
Thus, {AF} is incommensurable in length with {EG} [Prop. 10.13].
And as {AF} (is) to {EG}, so {AI} is to {EK} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {AI} is incommensurable with {EK} [Prop. 10.11].

Therefore, let the square {LM}, equal to {AI}, have been constructed.
And let {NO}, equal to {FK}, which is about the same angle as {LM}, have been subtracted (from {LM}).
Thus, {LM} and {NO} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].
Let {PR} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
Therefore, since the (rectangle contained) by {AF} and {FG} is equal to the (square) on {EG}, thus as {AF} is to {EG}, so {EG} (is) to {FG} [Prop. 6.17].
But, as {AF} (is) to {EG}, so {AI} is to {EK} [Prop.6.1].
And as {EG} (is) to {FG}, so {EK} is to {FK} [Prop. 6.1].
And thus as {AI} (is) to {EK}, so {EK} (is) to {FK} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, {EK} is the mean proportional to {AI} and {FK}.
And {MN} is also the mean proportional to the squares {LM} and {NO} [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
And {AI} is equal to {LM}, and {FK} to {NO}.
Thus, {EK} is also equal to {MN}.
But, {MN} is equal to {LO}, and {EK} [is] equal to {DH} [Prop. 1.43].
And thus the whole of {DK} is equal to the gnomon {UVW} and {NO}.
And {AK} (is) also equal to {LM} and {NO}.
Thus, the remainder {AB} is equal to {ST}---that is to say, to the square on {LN}.
Thus, {LN} is the square-root of area {AB}.
I say that {LN} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For since {AI} and {FK} were shown (to be) medial (areas), and are equal to the (squares) on {LP} and {PN} (respectively), the (squares) on each of {LP} and {PN} (are) thus also medial.
Thus, {LP} and {PN} (are) each medial (straight-lines).
And since {AI} is commensurable with {FK} [Props. 6.1, 10.11], the (square) on {LP} (is) thus also commensurable with the (square) on {PN}.
Again, since {AI} was shown (to be) incommensurable with {EK}, {LM} is thus also incommensurable with {MN}---that is to say, the (square) on {LP} with the (rectangle contained) by {LP} and {PN}.
Hence, {LP} is also incommensurable in length with {PN} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
Thus, {LP} and {PN} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
So, I say that they also contain a medial (area).

For since {EK} was shown (to be) a medial (area), and is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {LP} and {PN}, the (rectangle contained) by {LP} and {PN} is thus also medial.
Hence, {LP} and {PN} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and which contain a medial (area).
Thus, {LN} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.75].
And it is the square-root of area {AB}.

Thus, the square-root of area {AB} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
