To find a fourth apotome.

Let the rational (straight-line) {A magnitude}, and {BG magnitude} (which is) commensurable in length with {A magnitude}, be laid down.
Thus, {BG magnitude} is also a rational (straight-line).
And let the two numbers {DF magnitude} and {FE magnitude} be laid down such that the whole, {DE magnitude}, does not have to each of {DF magnitude} and {EF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let it have been contrived that as {DE magnitude} (is) to {EF magnitude}, so the square on {BG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
The (square) on {BG magnitude} is thus commensurable with the (square) on {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And the (square) on {BG magnitude} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {GC magnitude} (is) also rational.
Thus, {GC magnitude} (is) a rational (straight-line).
And since {DE magnitude} does not have to {EF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {BG magnitude} thus does not have to the (square) on {GC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {BG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {BG magnitude} and {GC magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {BC magnitude} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
[So, I say that (it is) also a fourth (apotome).]

Now, let the (square) on {H magnitude} be that (area) by which the (square) on {BG magnitude} is greater than the (square) on {GC magnitude} [Prop. 10.13 lem.].
Therefore, since as {DE magnitude} is to {EF magnitude}, so the (square) on {BG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GC magnitude}, thus, also, via conversion, as {ED magnitude} is to {DF magnitude}, so the (square) on {GB magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {H magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {ED magnitude} does not have to {DF magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {GB magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {H magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {BG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {H magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
And the square on {BG magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GC magnitude} by the (square) on {H magnitude}.
Thus, the square on {BG magnitude} is greater than (the square) on {GC magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({BG magnitude}).
And the whole, {BG magnitude}, is commensurable in length with the the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {A magnitude}.
Thus, {BC magnitude} is a fourth apotome [Def. 10.14].

Thus, a fourth apotome has been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
