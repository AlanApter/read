A medial (area) being subtracted from a rational (area), one of two irrational (straight-lines) arise (as) the square-root of the remaining area---either an apotome, or a minor (straight-line).

For let the medial (area) {BD} have been subtracted from the rational (area) {BC}.
I say that one of two irrational (straight-lines) arise (as) the square-root of the remaining (area), {EC}---either an apotome, or a minor (straight-line).

For let the rational (straight-line) {FG} have been laid out, and let the right-angled parallelogram {GH}, equal to {BC}, have been applied to {FG}, and let {GK}, equal to {DB}, have been subtracted (from {GH}).
Thus, the remainder {EC} is equal to {LH}.
Therefore, since {BC} is a rational (area), and {BD} a medial (area), and {BC} (is) equal to {GH}, and {BD} to {GK}, {GH} is thus a rational (area), and {GK} a medial (area).
And they are applied to the rational (straight-line) {FG}.
Thus, {FH} (is) rational, and commensurable in length with {FG} [Prop. 10.20], and {FK} (is) also rational, and incommensurable in length with {FG} [Prop. 10.22].
Thus, {FH} is incommensurable in length with {FK} [Prop. 10.13].
{FH} and {FK} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {KH} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73], and {KF} an attachment to it.
So, the square on {HF} is greater than (the square on) {FK} by the (square) on (some straightline which is) either commensurable, or not (commensurable), (in length with {HF}).

First, let the square (on it) be (greater) by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) commensurable (in length with {HF}).
And the whole of {HF} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {FG}.
Thus, {KH} is a first apotome [Def. 10.1].
And the square-root of an (area) contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first apotome is an apotome [Prop. 10.91].
Thus, the square-root of {LH}---that is to say, (of) {EC}---is an apotome.

And if the square on {HF} is greater than (the square on) {FK} by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({HF}), and (since) the whole of {FH} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {FG}, {KH} is a fourth apotome [Prop. 10.14].
And the square-root of an (area) contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth apotome is a minor (straight-line) [Prop. 10.94].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
