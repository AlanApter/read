5. Given a rational (straight-line), and a binomial (straight-line) which has been divided into its (component) terms, of which the square on the greater term is larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with (the greater) then, if the greater term is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line previously) laid out, let [the whole] (straight-line) be called a first binomial (straight-line).

6. And if the lesser term is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line previously) laid out then let (the whole straight-line) be called a second binomial (straight-line).

7. And if neither of the terms is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line previously) laid out then let (the whole straight-line) be called a third binomial (straight-line).

8. So, again, if the square on the greater term is larger than (the square on) [the lesser] by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with (the greater) then, if the greater term is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line previously) laid out, let (the whole straight-line) be called a fourth binomial (straight-line).

9. And if the lesser (term is commensurable), a fifth (binomial straight-line).

10. And if neither (term is commensurable), a sixth (binomial straight-line).
