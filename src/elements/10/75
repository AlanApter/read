If a medial (straight-line), which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and which contains a medial (area) with the whole, is subtracted from a(nother) medial (straight-line) then the remainder is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For let the medial (straight-line) {CB}, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, {AB}, and which contains with the whole, {AB}, the medial (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC}, have been subtracted from the medial (straight-line) {AB} [Prop. 10.28].
I say that the remainder {AC} is an irrational (straight-line).
Let it be called a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

For let the rational (straight-line) {DI} be laid down.
And let {DE}, equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AB} and {BC}, have been applied to {DI}, producing {DG} as breadth.
And let {DH}, equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC}, have been applied to {DI}, producing {DF} as breadth.
The remainder {FE} is thus equal to the (square) on {AC} [Prop. 2.7].
And since the (squares) on {AB} and {BC} are medial and commensurable (with one another), {DE} (is) thus also medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {DI}, producing {DG} as breadth.
Thus, {DG} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {DI} [Prop. 10.22].
Again, since the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} is medial, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} is thus also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
And it is equal to {DH}.
Thus, {DH} is also medial.
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {DI}, producing {DF} as breadth.
{DF} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {DI} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {AB} and {BC} are commensurable in square only, {AB} is thus incommensurable in length with {BC}.
Thus, the square on {AB} (is) also incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} [Props. 10.21 lem., 10.11].
But, the (sum of the squares) on {AB} and {BC} is commensurable with the (square) on {AB} [Prop. 10.15], and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC} is incommensurable with the (sum of the squares) on {AB} and {BC} [Prop. 10.13].
And {DE} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AB} and {BC}, and {DH} to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB} and {BC}.
Thus, {DE} [is] incommensurable with {DH}.
And as {DE} (is) to {DH}, so {GD} (is) to {DF} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {GD} is incommensurable with {DF} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {GD} and {DF} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {FG} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
And {DI} (is) rational.
And the (area) contained by a rational and an irrational (straight-line) is irrational [Prop. 10.20], and its square-root is irrational.


And {AC} is the square-root of {FE}.
Thus, {AC} is an irrational (straight-line) [Def. 10.4].
And let it be called the second apotome of a medial (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
