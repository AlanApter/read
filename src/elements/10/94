If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth apotome then the square-root of the area is a minor (straight-line).

For let the area {AB} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC} and the fourth apotome {AD}.
I say that the square-root of area {AB} is a minor (straight-line).
For let {DG} be an attachment to {AD}.
Thus, {AG} and {DG} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73], and {AG} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC}, and the square on the whole, {AG}, is greater than (the square on) the attachment, {DG}, by the square on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with ({AG}) [Def. 10.14].
Therefore, since the square on {AG} is greater than (the square on) {GD} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with ({AG}), thus if (some area), equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {DG}, is applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG}) into (parts which are) incommensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.18].
Therefore, let {DG} have been cut in half at {E}, and let (some area), equal to the (square) on {EG}, have been applied to {AG}, falling short by a square figure, and let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF} and {FG}.
Thus, {AF} is incommensurable in length with {FG}.
Therefore, let {EH}, {FI}, and {GK} have been drawn through {E}, {F}, and {G} (respectively), parallel to {AC} and {BD}.
Therefore, since {AG} is rational, and commensurable in length with {AC}, the whole (area) {AK} is thus rational [Prop. 10.19].
Again, since {DG} is incommensurable in length with {AC}, and both are rational (straight-lines), {DK} is thus a medial (area) [Prop. 10.21].
Again, since {AF} is incommensurable in length with {FG}, {AI} (is) thus also incommensurable with {FK} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].

Therefore, let the square {LM}, equal to {AI}, have been constructed.
And let {NO}, equal to {FK}, (and) about the same angle, {LPM}, have been subtracted (from {LM}).
Thus, the squares {LM} and {NO} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].
Let {PR} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.
Therefore, since the (rectangle contained) by {AF} and {FG} is equal to the (square) on {EG}, thus, proportionally, as {AF} is to {EG}, so {EG} (is) to {FG} [Prop. 6.17].
But, as {AF} (is) to {EG}, so {AI} is to {EK}, and as {EG} (is) to {FG}, so {EK} is to {FK} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EK} is the mean proportional to {AI} and {FK} [Prop. 5.11].
And {MN} is also the mean proportional to the squares {LM} and {NO} [Prop. 10.13 lem.], and {AI} is equal to {LM}, and {FK} to {NO}.
{EK} is thus also equal to {MN}.
But, {DH} is equal to {EK}, and {LO} is equal to {MN} [Prop. 1.43].
Thus, the whole of {DK} is equal to the gnomon {UVW} and {NO}.
Therefore, since the whole of {AK} is equal to the (sum of the) squares {LM} and {NO}, of which {DK} is equal to the gnomon {UVW} and the square {NO}, the remainder {AB} is thus equal to {ST}---that is to say, to the square on {LN}.
Thus, {LN} is the square-root of area {AB}.
I say that {LN} is the irrational (straight-line which is) called minor.

For since {AK} is rational, and is equal to the (sum of the) squares {LP} and {PN}, the sum of the (squares) on {LP} and {PN} is thus rational.
Again, since {DK} is medial, and {DK} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {LP} and {PN}, thus twice the (rectangle contained) by {LP} and {PN} is medial.
And since {AI} was shown (to be) incommensurable with {FK}, the square on {LP} (is) thus also incommensurable with the square on {PN}.
Thus, {LP} and {PN} are (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them medial.
{LN} is thus the irrational (straight-line) called minor [Prop. 10.76].
And it is the square-root of area {AB}.

Thus, the square-root of area {AB} is a minor (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
