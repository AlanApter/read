A second bimedial (straight-line) can be divided (into its component terms) at one point only.

Let {AB} be a second bimedial (straight-line) which has been divided at {C}, so that {AC} and {BC} are medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area) [Prop. 10.38].
So, (it is) clear that {C} is not (located) at the point of bisection, since ({AC} and {BC}) are not commensurable in length.
I say that {AB} cannot be (so) divided at another point.

For, if possible, let it also have been (so) divided at {D}, so that {AC} is not the same as {DB}, but {AC} (is), by hypothesis, greater.
So, (it is) clear that (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD} and {DB} is also less than (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB}, as we showed above [Prop. 10.41 lem.].
And {AD} and {DB} are medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area).
And let the rational (straight-line) {EF} be laid down.
And let the rectangular parallelogram {EK}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {EF}.
And let {EG}, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB}, have been cut off (from {EK}).
Thus, the remainder, {HK}, is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 2.4].
So, again, let {EL}, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD} and {DB}---which was shown (to be) less than (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB}---have been cut off (from {EK}).
And, thus, the remainder, {MK}, (is) equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB}.
And since (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is medial, {EG} (is) thus [also] medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}.
Thus, {EH} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.22].
So, for the same (reasons), {HN} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF}.
And since {AC} and {CB} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, {AC} is thus incommensurable in length with {CB}.
And as {AC} (is) to {CB}, so the (square) on {AC} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.21 lem.].
Thus, the (square) on {AC} is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.11].
But, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is commensurable with the (square) on {AC}.
For, {AC} and {CB} are commensurable in square [Prop. 10.15].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.6].
And thus (the sum of) the squares on {AC} and {CB} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB} [Prop. 10.13].
But, {EG} is equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB}, and {HK} equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC} and {CB}.
Thus, {EG} is incommensurable with {HK}.
Hence, {EH} is also incommensurable in length with {HN} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And (they are) rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {EH} and {HN} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And if two rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only are added together then the whole (straight-line) is that irrational called binomial [Prop. 10.36].
Thus, {EN} is a binomial (straightline) which has been divided (into its component terms) at {H}.
So, according to the same (reasoning), {EM} and {MN} can be shown (to be) rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And {EN} will (thus) be a binomial (straight-line) which has been divided (into its component terms) at the different (points) {H} and {M} (which is absurd [Prop. 10.42]).
And {EH} is not the same as {MN}, since (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB} is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD} and {DB}.
But, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD} and {DB} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB} [Prop. 10.59 lem.].
Thus, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC} and {CB}---that is to say, {EG}---is also much greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD} and {DB}---that is to say, {MK}.
Hence, {EH} is also greater than {MN} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {EH} is not the same as {MN}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
