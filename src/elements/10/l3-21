If there are two straight-lines then as the first is to the second, so the (square) on the first (is) to the (rectangle contained) by the two straight-lines.

Let {{FE} line} and {{EG} line} be two straight-lines.
I say that as {{FE} line} is to {{EG} line}, so the (square) on {{FE} line} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {{FE} line} and {{EG} line}.

For let the square {{DF} polygon} have been described on {{FE} line}.
And let {{GD} polygon} have been completed.
Therefore, since as {{FE} line} is to {{EG} line}, so {{FD} polygon} (is) to {{DG} polygon} [Prop. 6.1], and {{FD} polygon} is the (square) on {{FE} line}, and {{DG} polygon} the (rectangle contained) by {{DE} line} and {{EG} line}---that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by {{FE} line} and {{EG} line}---thus as {{FE} line} is to {{EG} line}, so the (square) on {{FE} line} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {{FE} line} and {{EG} line}.
And also, similarly, as the (rectangle contained) by {{GE} line} and {{EF} line} is to the (square on) {{EF} line}---that is to say, as {{GD} polygon} (is) to {{FD} polygon}---so {{GE} line} (is) to {{EF} line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
