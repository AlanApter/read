To find a first apotome.

Let the rational (straight-line) {A} be laid down.
And let {BG} be commensurable in length with {A}.
{BG} is thus also a rational (straight-line).
And let two square numbers {DE} and {EF} be laid down, and let their difference {FD} be not square [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
Thus, {ED} does not have to {DF} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let it have been contrived that as {ED} (is) to {DF}, so the square on {BG} (is) to the square on {GC} [Prop. 10.6. corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {BG} is commensurable with the (square) on {GC} [Prop. 10.6].
And the (square) on {BG} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {GC} (is) also rational.
Thus, {GC} is also rational.
And since {ED} does not have to {DF} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {BG} thus does not have to the (square) on {GC} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {BG} is incommensurable in length with {GC} [Prop. 10.9].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {BG} and {GC} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, {BC} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a first (apotome).

Let the (square) on {H} be that (area) by which the (square) on {BG} is greater than the (square) on {GC} [Prop. 10.13 lem.].
And since as {ED} is to {FD}, so the (square) on {BG} (is) to the (square) on {GC}, thus, via conversion, as {DE} is to {EF}, so the (square) on {GB} (is) to the (square) on {H} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And {DE} has to {EF} the ratio which (some) square-number (has) to (some) square-number.
For each is a square (number).
Thus, the (square) on {GB} also has to the (square) on {H} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, {BG} is commensurable in length with {H} [Prop. 10.9].
And the square on {BG} is greater than (the square on) {GC} by the (square) on {H}.
Thus, the square on {BG} is greater than (the square on) {GC} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({BG}).
And the whole, {BG}, is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {A}.
Thus, {BC} is a first apotome [Def. 10.11].

Thus, the first apotome {BC} has been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to find.
