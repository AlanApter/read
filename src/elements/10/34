To find two straight-lines (which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them rational.

Let the two medial (straight-lines) {AB line} and {BC line}, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid out having the (rectangle contained) by them rational, (and) such that the square on {AB line} is greater than (the square on) {BC line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({AB line}) [Prop. 10.31].
And let the semi-circle {ADB arc O} have been drawn on {AB line}.
And let {BC line} have been cut in half at {E point}.
And let a (rectangular) parallelogram equal to the (square) on {BE line}, (and) falling short by a square figure, have been applied to {AB line}, (and let it be) the (rectangle contained by) {AF line} and {FB line} [Prop. 6.28].
Thus, {AF line} [is] incommensurable in length with {FB line} [Prop. 10.18].
And let {FD line} have been drawn from {F point} at right-angles to {AB line}.
And let {AD line} and {DB line} have been joined.

Since {AF line} is incommensurable (in length) with {FB line}, the (rectangle contained) by {BA line} and {AF line} is thus also incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BF line} [Prop. 10.11].
And the (rectangle contained) by {BA line} and {AF line} (is) equal to the (square) on {AD line}, and the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BF line} to the (square) on {DB line} [Prop. 10.32 lem.].
Thus, the (square) on {AD line} is also incommensurable with the (square) on {DB line}.
And since the (square) on {AB line} is medial, the sum of the (squares) on {AD line} and {DB line} (is) thus also medial [Props. 3.31, 1.47].
And since {BC line} is double {DF line} [see previous proposition], the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line} (is) thus also double the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {FD line}.
And the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line} (is) rational.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {FD line} (is) also rational [Prop. 10.6, Def. 10.4].
And the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {FD line} (is) equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AD line} and {DB line} [Prop. 10.32 lem.].
And hence the (rectangle contained) by {AD line} and {DB line} is rational.

Thus, two straight-lines, {AD line} and {DB line}, (which are) incommensurable in square, have been found, making the sum of the squares on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them rational.
(Which is) the verything it was required to show.
