The (square) on a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a third apotome as breadth.

Let {AB} be the second apotome of a medial (straight-line), and {CD} a rational (straight-line).
And let {CE}, equal to the (square) on {AB}, have been applied to {CD}, producing {CF} as breadth.
I say that {CF} is a third apotome.

For let {BG} be an attachment to {AB}.
Thus, {AG} and {GB} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a medial (area) [Prop. 10.75].
And let {CH}, equal to the (square) on {AG}, have been applied to {CD}, producing {CK} as breadth.
And let {KL}, equal to the (square) on {BG}, have been applied to {KH}, producing {KM} as breadth.
Thus, the whole of {CL} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB} [and the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB} is medial].
{CL} (is) thus also medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].
And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD}, producing {CM} as breadth.
Thus, {CM} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD} [Prop. 10.22].
And since the whole of {CL} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}, of which {CE} is equal to the (square) on {AB}, the remainder {LF} is thus equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} [Prop. 2.7].
Therefore, let {FM} have been cut in half at point {N}.
And let {NO} have been drawn parallel to {CD}.
Thus, {FO} and {NL} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}.
And the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} (is) medial.
Thus, {FL} is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}, producing {FM} as breadth.
{FM} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {AG} and {GB} are commensurable in square only, {AG} [is] thus incommensurable in length with {GB}.
Thus, the (square) on {AG} is also incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
But, the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB} is commensurable with the (square) on {AG}, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} with the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}.
The (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} [Prop. 10.13].
But, {CL} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG} and {GB}, and {FL} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}.
Thus, {CL} is incommensurable with {FL}.
And as {CL} (is) to {FL}, so {CM} is to {FM} [Prop. 6.1].
{CM} is thus incommensurable in length with {FM} [Prop. 10.11].
And they are both rational (straight-lines).
Thus, {CM} and {MF} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
{CF} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
So, I say that (it is) also a third (apotome).

For since the (square) on {AG} is commensurable with the (square) on {GB}, {CH} (is) thus also commensurable with {KL}.
Hence, {CK} (is) also (commensurable in length) with {KM} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And since the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB} is the mean proportional to the (squares) on {AG} and {GB} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and {CH} is equal to the (square) on {AG}, and {KL} equal to the (square) on {GB}, and {NL} equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG} and {GB}, {NL} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH} and {KL}.
Thus, as {CH} is to {NL}, so {NL} (is) to {KL}.
But, as {CH} (is) to {NL}, so {CK} is to {NM}, and as {NL} (is) to {KL}, so {NM} (is) to {KM} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, as {CK} (is) to {MN}, so {MN} is to {KM} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {CK} and {KM} is equal to the [(square) on {MN}---that is to say, to the] fourth part of the (square) on {FM} [Prop. 6.17].
Therefore, since {CM} and {MF} are two unequal straight-lines, and (some area), equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM}, has been applied to {CM}, falling short by a square figure, and divides it into commensurable (parts), the square on {CM} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({CM}) [Prop. 10.17].
And neither of {CM} and {MF} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD}.
{CF} is thus a third apotome [Def. 10.13].

Thus, the (square) on a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a third apotome as breadth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
