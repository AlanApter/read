If two triangles have two angles equal to two angles, respectively, and one side equal to one side ---in fact, either that by the equal angles, or that subtending one of the equal angles--- then (the triangles) will also have the remaining sides equal to the [corresponding] remaining sides, and the remaining angle (equal) to the remaining angle.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be two triangles having the two angles {ABC angle} and {BCA angle} equal to the two (angles) {DEF angle} and {EFD angle}, respectively.
(That is) {ABC angle} to {DEF angle}, and {BCA angle} to {EFD angle}.
And let them also have one side equal to one side. First of all, the (side) by the equal angles. (That is) {BC line} (equal) to {EF line}.
I say that the remaining sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining sides. (That is) {AB line} to {DE line}, and {AC line} to {DF line}.
And the remaining angle (will be equal) to the remaining angle.  (That is) {BAC angle} to {EDF angle}.

For if {AB line} is unequal to {DE line} then one of them is greater.
Let {AB line} be greater, and let {BG line} be made equal to {DE line} [Prop. 1.3], and let {GC line} have been joined.

Therefore, since {BG line} is equal to {DE line}, and {BC line} to {EF line}, the two (straight-lines) {GB line}, {BC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DE line}, {EF line}, respectively.
And angle {GBC angle} is equal to angle {DEF angle}.
Thus, the base {GC line} is equal to the base {DF line}, and triangle {GBC polygon} is equal to triangle {DEF polygon}, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the (corresponding) remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, {GCB angle} (is equal) to {DFE angle}.
But, {DFE angle} was assumed (to be) equal to {BCA angle}.
Thus, {BCG angle} is also equal to {BCA angle}, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing (is) impossible.
Thus, {AB line} is not unequal to {DE line}.
Thus, (it is) equal.
And {BC line} is also equal to {EF line}.
So the two (straight-lines) {AB line}, {BC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DE line}, {EF line}, respectively.
And angle {ABC angle} is equal to angle {DEF angle}.
Thus, the base {AC line} is equal to the base {DF line}, and the remaining angle {BAC angle} is equal to the remaining angle {EDF angle} [Prop. 1.4].

But, again, let the sides subtending the equal angles be equal: for instance, (let) {AB line} (be equal) to {DE line}.
Again, I say that the remaining sides will be equal to the remaining sides.
(That is) {AC line} to {DF line}, and {BC line} to {EF line}.
Furthermore, the remaining angle {BAC angle} is equal to the remaining angle {EDF angle}.

For if {BC line} is unequal to {EF line} then one of them is greater.
If possible, let {BC line} be greater.
And let {BH line} be made equal to {EF line} [Prop. 1.3], and let {AH line} have been joined.
And since {BH line} is equal to {EF line}, and {AB line} to {DE line}, the two (straight-lines) {AB line}, {BH line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DE line}, {EF line}, respectively.
And the angles they encompass (are also equal).
Thus, the base {AH line} is equal to the base {DF line}, and the triangle {ABH polygon} is equal to the triangle {DEF polygon}, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the (corresponding) remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, angle {BHA angle} is equal to {EFD angle}.
But, {EFD angle} is equal to {BCA angle}. So, for triangle {AHC polygon}, the external angle {BHA angle} is equal to the internal and opposite angle {BCA angle}.
The very thing (is) impossible [Prop. 1.16].
Thus, {BC line} is not unequal to {EF line}.
Thus, (it is) equal.
And {AB line} is also equal to {DE line}.
So the two (straight-lines) {AB line}, {BC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DE line}, {EF line}, respectively.
And they encompass equal angles.
Thus, the base {AC line} is equal to the base {DF line}, and triangle {ABC polygon} (is) equal to triangle {DEF polygon}, and the remaining angle {BAC angle} (is) equal to the remaining angle {EDF angle} [Prop. 1.4].

Thus, if two triangles have two angles equal to two angles, respectively, and one side equal to one side ---in fact, either that by the equal angles, or that subtending one of the equal angles--- then (the triangles) will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides, and the remaining angle (equal) to the remaining angle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
