Parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.

Let ABCD and EFGH be parallelograms which are on the equal bases BC and FG, and (are) between the same parallels AH and BG.
I say that the parallelogram ABCD is equal to EFGH.

For let BE and CH have been joined.
And since BC and FG are equal, but FG and EH are equal [Prop. 1.34], BC and EH are thus also equal.
And they are also parallel, and EB and HC join them.
But (straight-lines) joining equal and parallel (straight-lines) on the same sides are (themselves) equal and parallel [Prop. 1.33] [thus, EB and HC are also equal and parallel].
Thus, EBCH is a parallelogram [Prop. 1.34], and is equal to ABCD.
For it has the same base, BC, as (ABCD), and is between the same parallels, BC and AH, as (ABCD) [Prop. 1.35].
So, for the same (reasons), EFGH is also equal to the same (parallelogram) EBCH [Prop. 1.34].
So that the parallelogram ABCD is also equal to EFGH.

Thus, parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
