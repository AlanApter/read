In equal circles, equal straight-lines subtend equal circumferences.

Let {ABC circle K} and {DEF circle L} be equal circles, and within them let the equal circumferences {BGC arcc K} and {EHF arcc L} have been cut off.
And let the straight-lines {BC line} and {EF line} have been joined. I say that {BC line} is equal to {EF line}.

For let the centers of the circles have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let them be (at) {K point} and {L point}. And let {BK line}, {KC line}, {EL line}, and {LF line} have been joined.

And since the circumference {BGC arcc K} is equal to the circumference {EHF arcc L}, the angle {BKC angle} is also equal to (angle) {ELF angle} [Prop. 3.27].
And since the circles {ABC circle K} and {DEF circle L} are equal, their radii are also equal [Def. 3.1].
So the two (straight-lines) {BK line}, {KC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {EL line}, {LF line} (respectively).
And they contain equal angles.
Thus, the base {BC line} is equal to the base {EF line} [Prop. 1.4].

Thus, in equal circles, equal straight-lines subtend equal circumferences.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
