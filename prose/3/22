For quadrilaterals within circles, the (sum of the) opposite angles is equal to two right-angles.

Let {ABCD circle E} be a circle, and let {ABCD polygon} be a quadrilateral within it.
I say that the (sum of the) opposite angles is equal to two right-angles.

Let {AC line} and {BD line} have been joined.

Therefore, since the three angles of any triangle are equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.32], the three angles {CAB angle}, {ABC angle}, and {BCA angle} of triangle {ABC polygon} are thus equal to two right-angles.
And {CAB angle} (is) equal to {BDC angle}.
For they are in the same segment {BADC arcc E} [Prop. 3.21].
And {ACB angle} (is equal) to {ADB angle}.
For they are in the same segment {ADCB arcc E} [Prop. 3.21].
Thus, the whole of {ADC angle} is equal to {BAC angle} and {ACB angle}.
Let {ABC angle} have been added to both.
Thus, {ABC angle}, {BAC angle}, and {ACB angle} are equal to {ABC angle} and {ADC angle}.
But, {ABC angle}, {BAC angle}, and {ACB angle} are equal to two right-angles.
Thus, {ABC angle} and {ADC angle} are also equal to two right-angles.
Similarly, we can show that angles {BAD angle} and {DCB angle} are also equal to two right-angles.

Thus, for quadrilaterals within circles, the (sum of the) opposite angles is equal to two right-angles.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
