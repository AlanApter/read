To find the center of a given circle.

Let {ABC circle F} be the given circle.
So it is required to find the center of circle {ABC circle F}.

Let some straight-line {AB line} have been drawn through ({ABC circle F}), at random, and let ({AB line}) have been cut in half at point {D point} [Prop. 1.9].
And let {DC line} have been drawn from {D point}, at right-angles to {AB line} [Prop. 1.11].
And let ({CD line}) have been drawn through to {E point}.
And let {CE line} have been cut in half at {F point} [Prop. 1.9].
I say that (point) {F point} is the center of the [circle] {ABC circle F}.

For (if) not then, if possible, let {G point} (be the center of the circle), and let {GA line}, {GD line}, and {GB line} have been joined.
And since {AD line} is equal to {DB line}, and {DG line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AD line}, {DG line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BD line}, {DG line}, respectively.
And the base {GA line} is equal to the base {GB line}.
For (they are both) radii.
Thus, angle {ADG angle} is equal to angle {GDB angle} [Prop. 1.8].
And when a straight-line stood upon (another) straight-line make adjacent angles (which are) equal to one another, each of the equal angles is a right-angle [Def. 1.10].
Thus, {GDB angle} is a right-angle.
And {FDB angle} is also a right-angle.
Thus, {FDB angle} (is) equal to {GDB angle}, the greater to the lesser.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, (point) {G point} is not the center of the circle {ABC circle F}.
So, similarly, we can show that neither is any other (point) except {F point}.

Thus, point {F point} is the center of the [circle] {ABC circle F}.

Corollary

So, from this, (it is) manifest that if any straight-line in a circle cuts any (other) straight-line in half, and at right-angles, then the center of the circle is on the former (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
