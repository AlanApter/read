For any triangle, (the sum of any) two angles is less than two right-angles, (the angles) being taken up in any (possible way).

Let {ABC polygon} be a triangle.
I say that (the sum of any) two angles of triangle {ABC polygon} is less than two right-angles, (the angles) being taken up in any (possible way).

For let {BC line} have been produced to {D point}.

And since the angle {ACD angle} is external to triangle {ABC polygon}, it is greater than the internal and opposite angle {ABC angle} [Prop. 1.16].
Let {ACB angle} have been added to both.
Thus, the (sum of the angles) {ACD angle} and {ACB angle} is greater than the (sum of the angles) {ABC angle} and {BCA angle}.
But, (the sum of) {ACD angle} and {ACB angle} is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
Thus, (the sum of) {ABC angle} and {BCA angle} is less than two right-angles.
Similarly, we can show that (the sum of) {BAC angle} and {ACB angle} is also less than two right-angles, and again (that the sum of) {CAB angle} and {ABC angle} (is less than two right-angles).

Thus, for any triangle, (the sum of any) two angles is less than two right-angles, (the angles) being taken up in any (possible way).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
