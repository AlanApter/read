To find the least number that will have given parts.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} be the given parts.
So it is required to find the least number which will have the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} (i.e., an Ath part, a Bth part, and a Cth part).

For let {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, and {F magnitude} be numbers having the same names as the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} (respectively).
And let the least number, {G magnitude}, measured by {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, and {F magnitude}, have been taken [Prop. 7.36].

Thus, {G magnitude} has parts called the same as {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, and {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.37].
And {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} are parts called the same as {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, and {F magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, {G magnitude} has the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
So I say that ({G magnitude}) is also the least (number having the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}).
For if not, there will be some number less than {G magnitude} which will have the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
Let it be {H magnitude}.
Since {H magnitude} has the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}, {H magnitude} will thus be measured by numbers called the same as the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} [Prop. 7.38].
And {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, and {F magnitude} are numbers called the same as the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, {H magnitude} is measured by {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, and {F magnitude}.
And ({H magnitude}) is less than {G magnitude}.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, there cannot be some number less than {G magnitude} which will have the parts {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and {C magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
