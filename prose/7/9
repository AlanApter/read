 If a number is part of a number, and another (number) is the same part of another, also, alternately, which(ever) part, or parts, the first (number) is of the third, the second (number) will also be the same part, or the same parts, of the fourth.

For let a number {A magnitude} be part of a number {BC magnitude}, and another (number) {D magnitude} (be) the same part of another {EF magnitude} that {A magnitude} (is) of {BC magnitude}.
I say that, also, alternately, which(ever) part, or parts, {A magnitude} is of {D magnitude}, {BC magnitude} is also the same part, or parts, of {EF magnitude}.

For since which(ever) part {A magnitude} is of {BC magnitude}, {D magnitude} is also the same part of {EF magnitude}, thus as many numbers as are in {BC magnitude} equal to {A magnitude}, so many are also in {EF magnitude} equal to {D magnitude}.
Let {BC magnitude} have been divided into {BG magnitude} and {GC magnitude}, equal to {A magnitude}, and {EF magnitude} into {EH magnitude} and {HF magnitude}, equal to {D magnitude}.
So the multitude of (divisions) {BG magnitude}, {GC magnitude} will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) {EH magnitude}, {HF magnitude}.

And since the numbers {BG magnitude} and {GC magnitude} are equal to one another, and the numbers {EH magnitude} and {HF magnitude} are also equal to one another, and the multitude of (divisions) {BG magnitude}, {GC magnitude} is equal to the multitude of (divisions) {EH magnitude}, {HF magnitude}, thus which(ever) part, or parts, {BG magnitude} is of {EH magnitude}, {GC magnitude} is also the same part, or the same parts, of {HF magnitude}.
And hence, which(ever) part, or parts, {BG magnitude} is of {EH magnitude}, the sum {BC magnitude} is also the same part, or the same parts, of the sum {EF magnitude} [Props. 7.5, 7.6].
And {BG magnitude} (is) equal to {A magnitude}, and {EH magnitude} to {D magnitude}.
Thus, which(ever) part, or parts, {A magnitude} is of {D magnitude}, {BC magnitude} is also the same part, or the same parts, of {EF magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
