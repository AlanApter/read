If a number is measured by some number then the (number) measured will have a part called the same as the measuring (number).

For let the number {A magnitude} be measured by some number {B magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} has a part called the same as {B magnitude}.

For as many times as {B magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, so many units let there be in {C magnitude}.
Since {B magnitude} measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {C magnitude}, and the unit {D magnitude} also measures {C magnitude} according to the units in it, the unit {D magnitude} thus measures the number {C magnitude} as many times as {B magnitude} (measures) {A magnitude}.
Thus, alternately, the unit {D magnitude} measures the number {B magnitude} as many times as {C magnitude} (measures) {A magnitude} [Prop. 7.15].
Thus, which(ever) part the unit {D magnitude} is of the number {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is also the same part of {A magnitude}.
And the unit {D magnitude} is a part of the number {B magnitude} called the same as it (i.e., a Bth part).
Thus, {C magnitude} is also a part of {A magnitude} called the same as {B magnitude} (i.e., {C magnitude} is the Bth part of {A magnitude}).
Hence, {A magnitude} has a part {C magnitude} which is called the same as {B magnitude} (i.e., {A magnitude} has a Bth part).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
