If two internal straight-lines are constructed on one of the sides of a triangle, from its ends, the constructed (straight-lines) will be less than the two remaining sides of the triangle, but will encompass a greater angle.

For let the two internal straight-lines {BD line} and {DC line} have been constructed on one of the sides {BC line} of the triangle {ABC polygon}, from its ends {B point} and {C point} (respectively).
I say that {BD line} and {DC line} are less than the (sum of the) two remaining sides of the triangle {BA line} and {AC line}, but encompass an angle {BDC angle} greater than {BAC angle}.

For let {BD line} have been drawn through to {E point}.
And since for every triangle (the sum of any) two sides is greater than the remaining (side) [Prop. 1.20],
for triangle {ABE polygon} the (sum of the) two sides {AB line} and {AE line} is thus greater than {BE line}.
Let {EC line} have been added to both.
Thus, (the sum of) {BA line} and {AC line} is greater than (the sum of) {BE line} and {EC line}.
Again, since in triangle {CED polygon} the (sum of the) two sides {CE line} and {ED line} is greater than {CD line}, let {DB line} have been added to both.
Thus, (the sum of) {CE line} and {EB line} is greater than (the sum of) {CD line} and {DB line}.
But, (the sum of) {BA line} and {AC line} was shown (to be) greater than (the sum of) {BE line} and {EC line}.
Thus, (the sum of) {BA line} and {AC line} is much greater than (the sum of) {BD line} and {DC line}.

Again, since for every triangle the external angle is greater than the internal and opposite (angles) [Prop. 1.16], for triangle {CDE polygon} the external angle {BDC angle} is thus greater than {CED angle}.
Accordingly, for the same (reason), the external angle {CEB angle} of the triangle {ABE polygon} is also greater than {BAC angle}.
But, {BDC angle} was shown (to be) greater than {CEB angle}.
Thus, {BDC angle} is much greater than {BAC angle}.

Thus, if two internal straight-lines are constructed on one of the sides of a triangle, from its ends, the con- structed (straight-lines) are less than the two remain- ing sides of the triangle, but encompass a greater angle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
