In equal circles, angles standing upon equal circumferences are equal to one another, whether they are standing at the center or at the circumference.

For let the angles {BGC angle} and {EHF angle} at the centers {G point} and {H point}, and the (angles) {BAC angle} and {EDF angle} at the circumferences, stand upon the equal circumferences {BC arcc G} and {EF arcc H}, in the equal circles {ABC circle G} and {DEF circle H} (respectively).
I say that angle {BGC angle} is equal to (angle) {EHF angle}, and {BAC angle} is equal to {EDF angle}.

For if {BGC angle} is unequal to {EHF angle}, one of them is greater.
Let {BGC angle} be greater, and let the (angle) {BGK angle}, equal to angle {EHF angle}, have been constructed on the straight-line {BG line}, at the point {G point} on it [Prop. 1.23].
But equal angles (in equal circles) stand upon equal circumferences, when they are at the centers [Prop. 3.26].
Thus, circumference {BK arcc G} (is) equal to circumference {EF arcc H}.
But, {EF arcc H} is equal to {BC arcc G}.
Thus, {BK arcc G} is also equal to {BC arcc G}, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, angle {BGC angle} is not unequal to {EHF angle}.
Thus, (it is) equal.
And the (angle) at {A point} is half {BGC angle}, and the (angle) at {D point} half {EHF angle} [Prop. 3.20].
Thus, the angle at {A point} (is) also equal to the (angle) at {D point}.

Thus, in equal circles, angles standing upon equal circumferences are equal to one another, whether they are standing at the center or at the circumference.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
