Definitions

1. Equal circles are (circles) whose diameters are equal, or whose (distances) from the centers (to the circumferences) are equal (i.e., whose radii are equal).

2. A straight-line said to touch a circle is any (straight-line) which, meeting the circle and being produced, does not cut the circle.

3. Circles said to touch one another are any (circles) which, meeting one another, do not cut one another.

4. In a circle, straight-lines are said to be equally far from the center when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the center are equal.

5. And (that straight-line) is said to be further (from the center) on which the greater perpendicular falls (from the center).

6. A segment of a circle is the figure contained by a straight-line and a circumference of a circle.

7. And the angle of a segment is that contained by a straight-line and a circumference of a circle.

8. And the angle in a segment is the angle contained by the joined straight-lines, when any point is taken on the circumference of a segment, and straight-lines are joined from it to the ends of the straight-line which is the base of the segment.

9. And when the straight-lines containing an angle cut off some circumference, the angle is said to stand upon that (circumference).

10. And a sector of a circle is the figure contained by the straight-lines surrounding an angle, and the circumference cut off by them, when the angle is constructed at the center of a circle.

11. Similar segments of circles are those accepting equal angles, or in which the angles are equal to one another.
