To draw a segment of a circle, accepting an angle equal to a given rectilinear angle, on a given straight-line.

Let AB be the given straight-line, and C the given rectilinear angle.
So it is required to draw a segment of a circle, accepting an angle equal to C, on the given straight-line AB.

So the [angle] C is surely either acute, a right-angle, or obtuse.
First of all, let it be acute.
And, as in the first diagram (from the left), let (angle) BAD, equal to angle C, have been constructed on the straight-line AB, at the point A (on it) [Prop. 1.23].
Thus, BAD is also acute.
Let AE have been drawn, at right-angles to DA [Prop. 1.11].  
And let AB have been cut in half at F [Prop. 1.10].
And let FG have been drawn from point F, at right-angles to AB [Prop. 1.11].
And let GB have been joined.

And since AF is equal to FB, and FG (is) common, the two (straight-lines) AF, FG are equal to the two (straight-lines) BF, FG (respectively).
And angle AF G (is) equal to [angle] BFG.
Thus, the base AG is equal to the base BG [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, the circle drawn with center G, and radius GA, will also go through B (as well as A).
Let it have been drawn, and let it be (denoted) ABE.
And let EB have been joined.
Therefore, since AD is at the extremity of diameter AE, (namely, point) A, at right-angles to AE, the (straight-line) AD thus touches the circle ABE [Prop. 3.16 corr.].
Therefore, since some straight-line AD touches the circle ABE, and some (other) straight-line AB has been drawn across from the point of contact A into circle ABE, angle DAB is thus equal to the angle AEB in the alternate segment of the circle [Prop. 3.32].
But, DAB is equal to C.
Thus, angle C is also equal to AEB.

Thus, a segment AEB of a circle, accepting the angle AEB (which is) equal to the given (angle) C, has been drawn on the given straight-line AB.

And so let C be a right-angle.
And let it again be necessary to draw a segment of a circle on AB, accepting an angle equal to the right-[angle] C.
Let the (angle) BAD [again] have been constructed, equal to the right-angle C [Prop. 1.23], as in the second diagram (from the left).
And let AB have been cut in half at F [Prop. 1.10].
And let the circle AEB have been drawn with center F, and radius either FA or FB.

Thus, the straight-line AD touches the circle ABE, on account of the angle at A being a right-angle [Prop. 3.16 corr.].
And angle BAD is equal to the angle in segment AEB.
For (the latter angle), being in a semi-circle, is also a right-angle [Prop. 3.31].
But, BAD is also equal to C.
Thus, the (angle) in (segment) AEB is also equal to C.

Thus, a segment AEB of a circle, accepting an angle equal to C, has again been drawn on AB.

And so let (angle) C be obtuse.
And let (angle) BAD, equal to (C), have been constructed on the straight-line AB, at the point A (on it) [Prop. 1.23], as in the third diagram (from the left).
And let AE have been drawn, at right-angles to AD [Prop. 1.11].
And let AB have again been cut in half at F [Prop. 1.10].
And let F G have been drawn, at right-angles to AB [Prop. 1.10].
And let GB have been joined.

And again, since AF is equal to FB, and FG (is) common, the two (straight-lines) AF , F G are equal to the two (straight-lines) BF, FG (respectively).
And angle AF G (is) equal to angle BF G.
Thus, the base AG is equal to the base BG [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, a circle of center G, and radius GA, being drawn, will also go through B (as well as A).
Let it go like AEB (in the third diagram from the left).
And since AD is at right-angles to the diameter AE, at its extremity, AD thus touches circle AEB [Prop. 3.16 corr.].
And AB has been drawn across (the circle) from the point of contact A.
Thus, angle BAD is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment AHB of the circle [Prop. 3.32].
But, angle BAD is equal to C.
Thus, the angle in segment AHB is also equal to C.

Thus, a segment AHB of a circle, accepting an angle equal to C, has been drawn on the given straight-line AB.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
