In a circle, if two straight-lines, which are not through the center, cut one another then they do not cut one another in half.

Let ABCD be a circle, and within it, let two straight-lines, AC and BD, which are not through the center, cut one another at (point) E.
I say that they do not cut one another in half.

For, if possible, let them cut one another in half, such that AE is equal to EC, and BE to ED.
And let the center of the circle ABCD have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let it be (at point) F, and let FE have been joined.

Therefore, since some straight-line through the center, FE, cuts in half some straight-line not through the center, AC, it also cuts it at right-angles [Prop. 3.3].
Thus, FEA is a right-angle.
Again, since some straight-line FE cuts in half some straight-line BD, it also cuts it at right- angles [Prop. 3.3].
Thus, FEB (is) a right-angle.
But FEA was also shown (to be) a right-angle.
Thus, FEA (is) equal to FEB, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, AC and BD do not cut one another in half.

Thus, in a circle, if two straight-lines, which are not through the center, cut one another then they do not cut one another in half.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
