If two circles touch one another externally then the (straight-line) joining their centers will go through the point of union.

For let two circles, ABC and ADE, touch one another externally at point A, and let the center F of ABC have been found [Prop. 3.1], and (the center) G of ADE [Prop. 3.1].
I say that the straight-line joining F to G will go through the point of union at A.

For (if) not then, if possible, let it go like FCDG (in the figure), and let AF and AG have been joined.

Therefore, since point F is the center of circle ABC, FA is equal to FC.
Again, since point G is the center of circle ADE, GA is equal to GD.
And FA was also shown (to be) equal to FC.
Thus, the (straight-lines) FA and AG are equal to the (straight-lines) FC and GD.
So the whole of FG is greater than FA and AG.
But, (it is) also less [Prop. 1.20].
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, the straight-line joining F to G cannot not go through the point of union at A.
Thus, (it will go) through it.

Thus, if two circles touch one another externally then the [straight-line] joining their centers will go through the point of union.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
