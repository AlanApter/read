If two circles touch one another externally then the (straight-line) joining their centers will go through the point of union.

For let two circles, {ABC circle L} and {ADE circle K}, touch one another externally at point {A point}, and let the center {F point} of {ABC circle L} have been found [Prop. 3.1], and (the center) {G point} of {ADE circle K} [Prop. 3.1].
I say that the straight-line joining {F point} to {G point} will go through the point of union at {A point}.

For (if) not then, if possible, let it go like {FCDG line} (in the figure), and let {AF line} and {AG line} have been joined.

Therefore, since point {F point} is the center of circle {ABC circle L}, {FA line} is equal to {FC line}.
Again, since point {G point} is the center of circle {ADE circle K}, {GA line} is equal to {GD line}.
And {FA line} was also shown (to be) equal to {FC line}.
Thus, the (straight-lines) {FA line} and {AG line} are equal to the (straight-lines) {FC line} and {GD line}.
So the whole of {FG line} is greater than {FA line} and {AG line}.
But, (it is) also less [Prop. 1.20].
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, the straight-line joining {F point} to {G point} cannot not go through the point of union at {A point}.
Thus, (it will go) through it.

Thus, if two circles touch one another externally then the [straight-line] joining their centers will go through the point of union.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
