If two circles touch one another then they will not have the same center.

For let the two circles {ABC circle G} and {CDE circle F} touch one another at point {C point}.
I say that they will not have the same center.

For, if possible, let {F point} be (the common center), and let {FC line} have been joined, and let {FEB line} have been drawn through (the two circles), at random.

Therefore, since point {F point} is the center of the circle {ABC circle G}, {FC line} is equal to {FB line}.
Again, since point {F point} is the center of the circle {CDE circle F}, {FC line} is equal to {FE line}.
But {FC line} was shown (to be) equal to {FB line}.
Thus, {FE line} is also equal to {FB line}, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, point {F point} is not the (common) center of the circles {ABC circle G} and {CDE circle F}.

Thus, if two circles touch one another then they will not have the same center.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
