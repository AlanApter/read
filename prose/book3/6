If two circles touch one another then they will not have the same center.

For let the two circles ABC and CDE touch one an- other at point C.
I say that they will not have the same center.

For, if possible, let F be (the common center), and let F C have been joined, and let FEB have been drawn through (the two circles), at random.

Therefore, since point F is the center of the circle ABC, FC is equal to FB.
Again, since point F is the center of the circle CDE, FC is equal to FE.
But FC was shown (to be) equal to F B.
Thus, FE is also equal to FB, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, point F is not the (common) center of the circles ABC and CDE.

Thus, if two circles touch one another then they will not have the same center.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
