In a circle, the angle at the center is double that at the circumference, when the angles have the same circumference base.

Let ABC be a circle, and let BEC be an angle at its center, and BAC (one) at (its) circumference.
And let them have the same circumference base BC.
I say that angle BEC is double (angle) BAC.

For being joined, let AE have been drawn through to F.

Therefore, since EA is equal to EB, angle EAB (is) also equal to EBA [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, angle EAB and EBA is double (angle) EAB.
And BEF (is) equal to EAB and EBA [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, BEF is also double EAB.
So, for the same (reasons), FEC is also double EAC.
Thus, the whole (angle) BEC is double the whole (angle) BAC.

So let another (straight-line) have been inflected, and let there be another angle, BDC.
And DE being joined, let it have been produced to G.
So, similarly, we can show that angle GEC is double EDC, of which GEB is double EDB.
Thus, the remaining (angle) BEC is double the (remaining angle) BDC.

Thus, in a circle, the angle at the center is double that at the circumference, when [the angles] have the same circumference base.
(Which is) the very thing it was re- quired to show.
