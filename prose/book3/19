If some straight-line touches a circle, and a straight- line is drawn from the point of contact, at right-[angles] to the tangent, then the center (of the circle) will be on the (straight-line) so drawn.

For let some straight-line DE touch the circle ABC at point C.
And let CA have been drawn from C, at right-angles to DE [Prop. 1.11].
I say that the center of the circle is on AC.

For (if) not, if possible, let F be (the center of the circle), and let CF have been joined.

[Therefore], since some straight-line DE touches the circle ABC, and FC has been joined from the center to the point of contact, FC is thus perpendicular to DE [Prop. 3.18].
Thus, FCE is a right-angle.
And ACE is also a right-angle.
Thus, FCE is equal to ACE, the lesser to the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, F is not the center of circle ABC.
So, similarly, we can show that neither is any (point) other (than one) on AC.

Thus, if some straight-line touches a circle, and a straight-line is drawn from the point of contact, at right-angles to the tangent, then the center (of the circle) will be on the (straight-line) so drawn.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
