In a circle, equal straight-lines are equally far from the center, and (straight-lines) which are equally far from the center are equal to one another.

Let {ABDC circle E} be a circle, and let {AB line} and {CD line} be equal straight-lines within it.
I say that {AB line} and {CD line} are equally far from the center.

For let the center of circle {ABDC circle E} have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let it be (at) {E point}.
And let {EF line} and {EG line} have been drawn from (point) {E point}, perpendicular to {AB line} and {CD line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.12].
And let {AE line} and {EC line} have been joined.

Therefore, since some straight-line, {EF line}, through the center (of the circle), cuts some (other) straight-line, {AB line}, not through the center, at right-angles, it also cuts it in half [Prop. 3.3].
Thus, {AF line} (is) equal to {FB line}.
Thus, {AB line} (is) double {AF line}.
So, for the same (reasons), {CD line} is also double {CG line}.
And {AB line} is equal to {CD line}.
Thus, {AF line} (is) also equal to {CG line}.
And since {AE line} is equal to {EC line}, the (square) on {AE line} (is) also equal to the (square) on {EC line}.
But, the (sum of the squares) on {AF line} and {EF line} (is) equal to the (square) on {AE line}.
For the angle at {F point} (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
And the (sum of the squares) on {EG line} and {GC line} (is) equal to the (square) on {EC line}.
For the angle at {G point} (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {AF line} and {FE line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {CG line} and {GE line}, of which the (square) on {AF line} is equal to the (square) on {CG line}.
For {AF line} is equal to {CG line}.
Thus, the remaining (square) on {FE line} is equal to the (remaining square) on {EG line}.
Thus, {EF line} (is) equal to {EG line}.
And straight-lines in a circle are said to be equally far from the center when perpendicular (straight-lines) which are drawn to them from the center are equal [Def. 3.4].
Thus, {AB line} and {CD line} are equally far from the center.

So, let the straight-lines {AB line} and {CD line} be equally far from the center.
That is to say, let {EF line} be equal to {EG line}.
I say that {AB line} is also equal to {CD line}.

For, with the same construction, we can, similarly, show that {AB line} is double {AF line}, and {CD line} (double) {CG line}.
And since {AE line} is equal to {CE line}, the (square) on {AE line} is equal to the (square) on {CE line}.
But, the (sum of the squares) on {EF line} and {FA line} is equal to the (square) on {AE line} [Prop. 1.47].
And the (sum of the squares) on {EG line} and {GC line} (is) equal to the (square) on {CE line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {EF line} and {FA line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {EG line} and {GC line}, of which the (square) on {EF line} is equal to the (square) on {EG line}.
For {EF line} (is) equal to {EG line}.
Thus, the remaining (square) on {AF line} is equal to the (remaining square) on {CG line}.
Thus, {AF line} (is) equal to {CG line}.
And {AB line} is double {AF line}, and {CD line} double {CG line}.
Thus, {AB line} (is) equal to {CD line}.

Thus, in a circle, equal straight-lines are equally far from the center, and (straight-lines) which are equally far from the center are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
