If two circles touch one another internally, and their centers are found, then the straight-line joining their cen- ters, being produced, will fall upon the point of union of the circles.

For let two circles, ABC and ADE, touch one another internally at point A, and let the center F of circle ABC have been found [Prop. 3.1], and (the center) G of (circle) ADE [Prop. 3.1].
I say that the straight-line joining G to F, being produced, will fall on A.

For (if) not then, if possible, let it fall like FGH (in the figure), and let AF and AG have been joined.

Therefore, since AG and GF is greater than F A, that is to say FH [Prop. 1.20], let FG have been taken from both.
Thus, the remainder AG is greater than the remainder GH.
And AG (is) equal to GD.
Thus, GD is also greater than GH, the lesser than the greater.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, the straight-line joining F to G will not fall outside (one circle but inside the other).
Thus, it will fall upon the point of union (of the circles) at point A.

Thus, if two circles touch one another internally, [and their centers are found], then the straight-line joining their centers, [being produced], will fall upon the point of union of the circles.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
