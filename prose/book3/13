A circle does not touch a(nother) circle at more than one point, whether they touch internally or externally.

For, if possible, let circle ABDC touch circle EBFD---first of all, internallyâ€”at more than one point, D and B.

And let the center G of circle ABDC have been found [Prop. 3.1], and (the center) H of EBFD [Prop. 3.1].

Thus, the (straight-line) joining G and H will fall on B and D [Prop. 3.11].
Let it fall like BGHD (in the figure).
And since point G is the center of circle ABDC, BG is equal to GD.
Thus, BG (is) greater than HD.
Thus, BH (is) much greater than HD.
Again, since point H is the center of circle EBFD, BH is equal to HD.
But it was also shown (to be) much greater than it.
The very thing (is) impossible.
Thus, a circle does not touch a(nother) circle internally at more than one point.

So, I say that neither (does it touch) externally (at more than one point).

For, if possible, let circle ACK touch circle ABDC externally at more than one point, A and C.
And let AC have been joined.

Therefore, since two points, A and C, have been taken at random on the circumference of each of the circles ABDC and ACK, the straight-line joining the points will fall inside each (circle) [Prop. 3.2].
But, it fell inside ABDC, and outside ACK [Def. 3.3].
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, a circle does not touch a(nother) circle externally at more than one point.
And it was shown that neither (does it) internally.
Thus, a circle does not touch a(nother) circle at more than one point, whether they touch internally or externally.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
