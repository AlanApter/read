In equal circles, equal straight-lines subtend equal circumferences.

Let ABC and DEF be equal circles, and within them let the equal circumferences BGC and EHF have been cut off.
And let the straight-lines BC and EF have been joined. I say that BC is equal to EF.

For let the centers of the circles have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let them be (at) K and L. And let BK, KC, EL, and LF have been joined.

And since the circumference BGC is equal to the circumference EHF, the angle BKC is also equal to (angle) ELF [Prop. 3.27].
And since the circles ABC and DEF are equal, their radii are also equal [Def. 3.1].
So the two (straight-lines) BK, KC are equal to the two (straight-lines) EL, LF (respectively).
And they contain equal angles.
Thus, the base BC is equal to the base EF [Prop. 1.4].

Thus, in equal circles, equal straight-lines subtend equal circumferences.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
