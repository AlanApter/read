If two straight-lines in a circle cut one another then the rectangle contained by the pieces of one is equal to the rectangle contained by the pieces of the other.

For let the two straight-lines {AC line} and {BD line}, in the circle {ABCD circle F}, cut one another at point {E point}.
I say that the rectangle contained by {AE line} and {EC line} is equal to the rectangle contained by {DE line} and {EB line}.

{figure 1}In fact, if {AC line} and {BD line} are through the center (as in the first diagram from the left), so that {E point} is the center of circle {ABCD circle F}, then (it is) clear that, {AE line}, {EC line}, {DE line}, and {EB line} being equal, the rectangle contained by {AE line} and {EC line} is also equal to the rectangle contained by {DE line} and {EB line}.

{figure 2}So let {AC line} and {DB line} not be though the center (as in the second diagram from the left), and let the center of {ABCD circle F} have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let it be (at) {F point}.
And let {FG line} and {FH line} have been drawn from {F point}, perpendicular to the straight-lines {AC line} and {DB line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.12].
And let {FB line}, {FC line}, and {FE line} have been joined.

And since some straight-line, {GF line}, through the center, cuts at right-angles some (other) straight-line, {AC line}, not through the center, then it also cuts it in half [Prop. 3.3].
Thus, {AG line} (is) equal to {GC line}.
Therefore, since the straight-line {AC line} is cut equally at {G point}, and unequally at {E point}, the rectangle contained by {AE line} and {EC line} plus the square on {EG line} is thus equal to the (square) on {GC line} [Prop. 2.5].
Let the (square) on {GF line} have been added [to both].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AE line} and {EC line} plus the (sum of the squares) on {GE line} and {GF line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {CG line} and {GF line}.
But, the (square) on {FE line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {EG line} and {GF line} [Prop. 1.47], and the (square) on {FC line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {CG line} and {GF line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AE line} and {EC line} plus the (square) on {FE line} is equal to the (square) on {FC line}.
And {FC line} (is) equal to {FB line}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AE line} and {EC line} plus the (square) on {FE line} is equal to the (square) on {FB line}.
So, for the same (reasons), the (rectangle contained) by {DE line} and {EB line} plus the (square) on {FE line} is equal to the (square) on {FB line}.
And the (rectangle contained) by {AE line} and {EC line} plus the (square) on {FE line} was also shown (to be) equal to the (square) on {FB line}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {AE line} and {EC line} plus the (square) on {FE line} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {DE line} and {EB line} plus the (square) on {FE line}.
Let the (square) on {FE line} have been taken from both.
Thus, the remaining rectangle contained by {AE line} and {EC line} is equal to the rectangle contained by {DE line} and {EB line}.

Thus, if two straight-lines in a circle cut one another then the rectangle contained by the pieces of one is equal to the rectangle contained by the pieces of the other.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
