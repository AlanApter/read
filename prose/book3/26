In equal circles, equal angles stand upon equal circumferences whether they are standing at the center or at the circumference.

Let {ABC circle G} and {DEF circle H} be equal circles, and within them let {BGC angle} and {EHF angle} be equal angles at the center, and {BAC angle} and {EDF angle} (equal angles) at the circumference.
I say that circumference {BKC arcc G} is equal to circumference {ELF arcc H}.

For let {BC line} and {EF line} have been joined.

And since circles {ABC circle G} and {DEF circle H} are equal, their radii are equal.
So the two (straight-lines) {BG line}, {GC line} (are) equal to the two (straight-lines) {EH line}, {HF line} (respectively).
And the angle at {G point} (is) equal to the angle at {H point}.
Thus, the base {BC line} is equal to the base {EF line} [Prop. 1.4].
And since the angle at {A point} is equal to the (angle) at {D point}, the segment {BAC arc G} is thus similar to the segment {EDF arc H} [Def. 3.11].
And they are on equal straight-lines [{BC line} and {EF line}].
And similar segments of circles on equal straight-lines are equal to one another [Prop. 3.24].
Thus, segment {BAC arc G} is equal to (segment) {EDF arc H}.
And the whole circle {ABC circle G} is also equal to the whole circle {DEF circle H}.
Thus, the remaining circumference {BKC arcc G} is equal to the (remaining) circumference {ELF arcc H}.

Thus, in equal circles, equal angles stand upon equal circumferences, whether they are standing at the center or at the circumference.
(Which is) the very thing which it was required to show.
