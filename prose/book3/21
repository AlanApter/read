In a circle, angles in the same segment are equal to one another.

Let ABCD be a circle, and let BAD and BED be angles in the same segment BAED.
I say that angles BAD and BED are equal to one another.

For let the center of circle ABCD have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let it be (at point) F.
And let BF and FD have been joined.

And since angle BFD is at the center, and BAD at the circumference, and they have the same circumference base BCD, angle BF D is thus double BAD [Prop. 3.20].

So, for the same (reasons), BFD is also double BED.
Thus, BAD (is) equal to BED.
Thus, in a circle, angles in the same segment are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
