Similar segments of circles on equal straight-lines are equal to one another.

For let {AEB arc K} and {CFD arc L} be similar segments of circles on the equal straight-lines {AB line} and {CD line} (respectively).
I say that segment {AEB arc K} is equal to segment {CFD arc L}.

For if the segment {AEB arc K} is applied to the segment {CFD arc L}, and point {A point} is placed on (point) {C point}, and the straight-line {AB line} on {CD line}, then point {B point} will also coincide with point {D point}, on account of {AB line} being equal to {CD line}.
And if {AB line} coincides with {CD line} then the segment {AEB arc K} will also coincide with {CFD arc L}.
For if the straight-line {AB line} coincides with {CD line}, and the segment {AEB arc K} does not coincide with {CFD arc L}, then it will surely either fall inside it, outside (it), or it will miss like {CGD given} (in the figure), and a circle (will) cut (another) circle at more than two points.
The very thing is impossible [Prop. 3.10].
Thus, if the straight-line {AB line} is applied to {CD line}, the segment {AEB arc K} cannot not also coincide with {CFD arc L}.
Thus, it will coincide, and will be equal to it [C.N. 4].

Thus, similar segments of circles on equal straight-lines are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
