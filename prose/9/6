If a number makes a cube (number by) multiplying itself then it itself will also be cube.

For let the number {A magnitude} make the cube (number) {B magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
I say that {A magnitude} is also cube.

For let {A magnitude} make {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}.
Therefore, since {A magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, and has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is thus cube.
And since {A magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, {A magnitude} thus measures {B magnitude} according to the units in ({A magnitude}).
And a unit also measures {A magnitude} according to the units in it.
Thus, as a unit is to {A magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
And since {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, {B magnitude} thus measures {C magnitude} according to the units in {A magnitude}.
And a unit also measures {A magnitude} according to the units in it.
Thus, as a unit is to {A magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}.
But, as a unit (is) to {A magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
And thus as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, (so) {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}.
And since {B magnitude} and {C magnitude} are cube, they are similar solid (numbers).
Thus, there exist two numbers in mean proportion (between) {B magnitude} and {C magnitude} [Prop. 8.19].
And as {B magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, (so) {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
Thus, there also exist two numbers in mean proportion (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} [Prop. 8.8].
And {B magnitude} is cube.
Thus, {A magnitude} is also cube [Prop. 8.23].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
