If a number makes a cube (number by) multiplying itself then it itself will also be cube.

For let the number A make the cube (number) B (by) multiplying itself. I say that A is also cube.

For let A make C (by) multiplying B. Therefore, since A has made B (by) multiplying itself, and has made C (by) multiplying B, C is thus cube. And since A has made B (by) multiplying itself, A thus measures B according to the units in (A). And a unit also measures A according to the units in it. Thus, as a unit is to A, so A (is) to B. And since A has made C (by) multiplying B, B thus measures C according to the units in A. And a unit also measures A according to the units in it. Thus, as a unit is toA,soB(is)toC.But,asaunit(is)toA,soA(is)to B.AndthusasA(is)toB,(so)B(is)toC.AndsinceB and C are cube, they are similar solid (numbers). Thus, there exist two numbers in mean proportion (between) BandC[Prop.8.19].AndasBistoC,(so)A(is)toB. Thus, there also exist two numbers in mean proportion (between) A and B [Prop. 8.8]. And B is cube. Thus, A is also cube [Prop. 8.23]. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
