If an even (number) is subtracted from an odd number then the remainder will be odd.

For let the even (number) BC have been subtracted from the odd (number) AB.
I say that the remainder CA is odd.

[For] let the unit AD have been subtracted (from AB).
DB is thus even [Def. 7.7].
And BC is also even.
Thus, the remainder CD is also even [Prop. 9.24].
CA (is) thus odd [Def. 7.7].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
