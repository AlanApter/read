If an odd (number) is subtracted from an odd number then the remainder will be even.

For let the odd (number) BC have been subtracted from the odd (number) AB.
I say that the remainder CA is even.

For since AB is odd, let the unit BD have been subtracted (from it).
Thus, the remainder AD is even [Def. 7.7].
So, for the same (reasons), CD is also even.
And hence the remainder CA is even [Prop. 9.24].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
