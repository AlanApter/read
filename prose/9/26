If an odd (number) is subtracted from an odd number then the remainder will be even.

For let the odd (number) {BC magnitude} have been subtracted from the odd (number) {AB magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {CA magnitude} is even.

For since {AB magnitude} is odd, let the unit {BD magnitude} have been subtracted (from it).
Thus, the remainder {AD magnitude} is even [Def. 7.7].
So, for the same (reasons), {CD magnitude} is also even.
And hence the remainder {CA magnitude} is even [Prop. 9.24].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
