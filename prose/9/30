If an odd number measures an even number then it will also measure (one) half of it.

For let the odd number A measure the even (number) B.
I say that (A) will also measure (one) half of (B).

For since A measures B, let it measure it according to C.
I say that C is not odd.
For, if possible, let it be (odd).
And since A measures B according to C, A has thus made B (by) multiplying C.
Thus, B is composed out of odd numbers, (and) the multitude of them is odd.
B is thus odd [Prop. 9.23].
The very thing (is) absurd.
For (B) was assumed (to be) even.
Thus, C is not odd.
Thus, C is even.
Hence, A measures B an even number of times.
So, on account of this, (A) will also measure (one) half of (B).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
