If an odd number measures an even number then it will also measure (one) half of it.

For let the odd number {A magnitude} measure the even (number) {B magnitude}.
I say that ({A magnitude}) will also measure (one) half of ({B magnitude}).

For since {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude}, let it measure it according to {C magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} is not odd.
For, if possible, let it be (odd).
And since {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude} according to {C magnitude}, {A magnitude} has thus made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}.
Thus, {B magnitude} is composed out of odd numbers, (and) the multitude of them is odd.
{B magnitude} is thus odd [Prop. 9.23].
The very thing (is) absurd.
For ({B magnitude}) was assumed (to be) even.
Thus, {C magnitude} is not odd.
Thus, {C magnitude} is even.
Hence, {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude} an even number of times.
So, on account of this, ({A magnitude}) will also measure (one) half of ({B magnitude}).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
