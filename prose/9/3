If a cube number makes some (number by) multiplying itself then the created (number) will be cube.

For let the cube number {A magnitude} make {B magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
I say that {B magnitude} is cube.

For let the side {C magnitude} of {A magnitude} have been taken.
And let {C magnitude} make {D magnitude} by multiplying itself.
So it is clear that {C magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
And since {C magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, {C magnitude} thus measures {D magnitude} according to the units in it [Def. 7.15].
But, in fact, a unit also measures {C magnitude} according to the units in it [Def. 7.20].
Thus, as a unit is to {C magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
Again, since {C magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}, {D magnitude} thus measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {C magnitude}.
And a unit also measures {C magnitude} according to the units in it.
Thus, as a unit is to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {A magnitude}.
But, as a unit (is) to {C magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
And thus as a unit (is) to {C magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {A magnitude}.
Thus, two numbers,{C magnitude} and {D magnitude}, have fallen (between) a unit and the number {A magnitude} in continued mean proportion.
Again, since {A magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, {A magnitude} thus measures {B magnitude} according to the units in it.
And a unit also measures {A magnitude} according to the units in it.
Thus, as a unit is to {A magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
And two numbers have fallen (between) a unit and {A magnitude} in mean proportion.
Thus two numbers will also fall (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.8].
And if two (numbers) fall (between) two numbers in mean proportion, and the first (number) is cube, then the second will also be cube [Prop. 8.23].
And {A magnitude} is cube.
Thus, {B magnitude} is also cube.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
