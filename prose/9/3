If a cube number makes some (number by) multiplying itself then the created (number) will be cube.

For let the cube number A make B (by) multiplying itself.
I say that B is cube.

For let the side C of A have been taken.
And let C make D by multiplying itself.
So it is clear that C has made A (by) multiplying D.
And since C has made D (by) multiplying itself, C thus measures D according to the units in it [Def. 7.15].
But, in fact, a unit also measures C according to the units in it [Def. 7.20].
Thus, as a unit is to C, so C (is) to D.
Again, since C has made A (by) multiplying D, D thus measures A according to the units in C.
And a unit also measures C according to the units in it.
Thus, as a unit is to C, so D (is) to A.
But, as a unit (is) to C, so C (is) to D.
And thus as a unit (is) to C, so C (is) to D, and D to A.
Thus, two numbers,C and D, have fallen (between) a unit and the number A in continued mean proportion.
Again, since A has made B (by) multiplying itself, A thus measures B according to the units in it.
And a unit also measures A according to the units in it.
Thus, as a unit is to A, so A (is) to B.
And two numbers have fallen (between) a unit and A in mean proportion.
Thus two numbers will also fall (between) A and B in mean proportion [Prop. 8.8].
And if two (numbers) fall (between) two numbers in mean proportion, and the first (number) is cube, then the second will also be cube [Prop. 8.23].
And A is cube.
Thus, B is also cube.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
