If a composite number makes some (number by) multiplying some (other) number then the created (number) will be solid.

For let the composite number A make C (by) multiplying some number B. I say that C is solid.

For since A is a composite (number), it will be measured by some number. Let it be measured by D. And, as many times as D measures A, so many units let there be in E. Therefore, since D measures A according to the units in E, E has thus made A (by) multiplying D [Def. 7.15]. And since A has made C (by) multiplying B, and A is the (number created) from (multiplying) D, E, the (number created) from (multiplying) D, E has thus made C (by) multiplying B. Thus, C is solid, and its sides are D, E, B. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
