If a composite number makes some (number by) multiplying some (other) number then the created (number) will be solid.

For let the composite number {A magnitude} make {C magnitude} (by) multiplying some number {B magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} is solid.

For since {A magnitude} is a composite (number), it will be measured by some number.
Let it be measured by {D magnitude}.
And, as many times as {D magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, so many units let there be in {E magnitude}.
Therefore, since {D magnitude} measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {E magnitude}, {E magnitude} has thus made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
And since {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, and {A magnitude} is the (number created) from (multiplying) {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, the (number created) from (multiplying) {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} has thus made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}.
Thus, {C magnitude} is solid, and its sides are {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {B magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
