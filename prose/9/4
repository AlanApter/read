If a cube number makes some (number by) multiplying a(nother) cube number then the created (number) will be cube.

For let the cube number {A magnitude} make {C magnitude} (by) multiplying the cube number {B magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} is cube.

For let {A magnitude} make {D magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
Thus, {D magnitude} is cube [Prop. 9.3].
And since {A magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, and has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, thus as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And since {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are cube, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar solid (numbers).
Thus, two numbers fall (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.19].
Hence, two numbers will also fall (between) {D magnitude} and {C magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.8].
And {D magnitude} is cube.
Thus, {C magnitude} (is) also cube [Prop. 8.23].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
