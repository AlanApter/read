If a number is neither (one) of the (numbers) doubled from a dyad, nor has an odd half, then it is (both) an even-times-even and an even-times-odd (number).

For let the number A neither be (one) of the (numbers) doubled from a dyad, nor let it have an odd half.
I say that A is (both) an even-times-even and an even-times-odd (number).

In fact, (it is) clear that A is an even-times-even (number) [Def. 7.8].
For it does not have an odd half.
So I say that it is also an even-times-odd (number).
For if we cut A in half, and (then cut) its half in half, and we do this continually, then we will arrive at some odd number which will measure A according to an even number.
For if not, we will arrive at a dyad, and A will be (one) of the (numbers) doubled from a dyad.
The very opposite thing (was) assumed.
Hence, A is an even-times-odd (number) [Def. 7.9].
And it was also shown (to be) an even-times-even (number).
Thus, A is (both) an even-times-even and an even-times-odd (number).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
