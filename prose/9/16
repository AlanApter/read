If two numbers are prime to one another then as the first is to the second, so the second (will) not (be) to some other (number).

For let the two numbers A and B be prime to one another.
I say that as A is to B, so B is not to some other (number).

For, if possible, let it be that as A (is) to B, (so) B (is) to C.
And A and B (are) prime (to one another).
And (numbers) prime (to one another are) also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as them) [Prop. 7.21].
And the least numbers measure those (numbers) having the same ratio (as them) an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [Prop. 7.20].
Thus, A measures B, as the leading (measuring) the leading.
And (A) also measures itself.
Thus, A measures A and B, which are prime to one another.
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, as A (is) to B, so B cannot be to C.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
