If an odd number is prime to some number then it will also be prime to its double.

For let the odd number A be prime to some number B.
And let C be double B.
I say that A is [also] prime to C.

For if [A and C] are not prime (to one another) then some number will measure them.
Let it measure (them), and let it be D.
And A is odd.
Thus, D (is) also odd.
And since D, which is odd, measures C, and C is even, [D] will thus also measure half of C [Prop. 9.30].
And B is half of C.
Thus, D measures B.
And it also measures A.
Thus, D measures (both) A and B, (despite) them being prime to one another.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, A is not unprime to C.
Thus, A and C are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
