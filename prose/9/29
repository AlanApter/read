If an odd number makes some (number by) multiplying an odd (number) then the created (number) will be odd.

For let the odd number A make C (by) multiplying the odd (number) B.
I say that C is odd.

For since A has made C (by) multiplying B, C is thus composed out of so many (magnitudes) equal to B, as many as (there) are units in A [Def. 7.15].
And each of A, B is odd.
Thus, C is composed out of odd (numbers), (and) the multitude of them is odd.
Hence C is odd [Prop. 9.23].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
