If an odd number makes some (number by) multiplying an odd (number) then the created (number) will be odd.

For let the odd number {A magnitude} make {C magnitude} (by) multiplying the odd (number) {B magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} is odd.

For since {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} is thus composed out of so many (magnitudes) equal to {B magnitude}, as many as (there) are units in {A magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
And each of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude} is odd.
Thus, {C magnitude} is composed out of odd (numbers), (and) the multitude of them is odd.
Hence {C magnitude} is odd [Prop. 9.23].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
