If any multitude whatsoever of even numbers is added together then the whole is even.

For let any multitude whatsoever of even numbers, AB, BC, CD, DE, lie together.
I say that the whole, AE, is even.

For since everyone of AB, BC, CD, DE is even, it has a half part [Def. 7.6].
And hence the whole AE has a half part.
And an even number is one (which can be) divided in half [Def. 7.6].
Thus, AE is even.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
