If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continuously proportional, (starting) from a unit, and the (number) after the unit is square, then all the remaining (numbers) will also be square. And if the (number) after the unit is cube, then all the remaining (numbers) will also be cube.

Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers, A, B, C, D, E, F, be continuously proportional, (starting) from a unit. And let the (number) after the unit, A, be square. I say that all the remaining (numbers) will also be square.

In fact, it has (already) been shown that the third (number) from the unit, B, is square, and all those (numbers after that) which leave an interval of one (number) [Prop. 9.8]. [So] I say that all the remaining (numbers) are also square. For since A, B, C are continuously proportional, and A (is) square, C is [thus] also square [Prop. 8.22]. Again, since B, C, D are [also] continuously proportional, and B is square, D is [thus] also square [Prop. 8.22]. So, similarly, we can show that all the remaining (numbers) are also square.

And so let A be cube. I say that all the remaining (numbers) are also cube.

In fact, it has (already) been shown that the fourth (number) from the unit, C, is cube, and all those (numbers after that) which leave an interval of two (numbers) [Prop. 9.8]. [So] I say that all the remaining (numbers) are also cube. For since as the unit is to A, so A (is) to B, the unit thus measures A the same number of times as A (measures) B. And the unit measures A according to the units in it. Thus, A also measures B according to the units in (A). A has thus made B (by) multiplying itself. And A is cube. And if a cube number makes some (number by) multiplying itself then the created (number) is cube [Prop. 9.3]. Thus, B is also cube. And since the four numbers A, B, C, D are continuously proportional, and A is cube, D is thus also cube [Prop. 8.23]. So, for the same (reasons), E is also cube, and, similarly, all the remaining (numbers) are cube. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
