If a number has an odd half then it is an even-time-odd (number) only.

For let the number {A magnitude} have an odd half.
I say that {A magnitude} is an even-times-odd (number) only.

In fact, (it is) clear that ({A magnitude}) is an even-times-odd (number).
For its half, being odd, measures it an even number of times [Def. 7.9].
So I also say that (it is an even-times-odd number) only.
For if {A magnitude} is also an even-times-even (number) then it will be measured by an even (number) according to an even number [Def. 7.8].
Hence, its half will also be measured by an even number, (despite) being odd.
The very thing is absurd.
Thus, {A magnitude} is an even-times-odd (number) only.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
