If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continuously proportional, (starting) from a unit, and the (number) after the unit is prime, then the greatest (number) will be measured by no [other] (numbers) except (numbers) existing among the proportional numbers.

Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers, {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, be continuously proportional, (starting) from a unit.
And let the (number) after the unit, {A magnitude}, be prime.
I say that the greatest of them, {D magnitude}, will be measured by no other (numbers) except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.

For, if possible, let it be measured by {E magnitude}, and let {E magnitude} not be the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
So it is clear that {E magnitude} is not prime.
For if {E magnitude} is prime, and measures {D magnitude}, then it will also measure {A magnitude}, (despite {A magnitude}) being prime (and) not being the same as it [Prop. 9.12].
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {E magnitude} is not prime.
Thus, (it is) composite.
And every composite number is measured by some prime number [Prop. 7.31].
Thus, {E magnitude} is measured by some prime number.
So I say that it will be measured by no other prime number than {A magnitude}.
For if {E magnitude} is measured by another (prime number), and {E magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, then this (prime number) will thus also measure {D magnitude}.
Hence, it will also measure {A magnitude}, (despite {A magnitude}) being prime (and) not being the same as it [Prop. 9.12].
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {A magnitude} measures {E magnitude}.
And since {E magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, let it measure it according to {F magnitude}.
I say that {F magnitude} is not the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
For if {F magnitude} is the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, and measures {D magnitude} according to {E magnitude}, then one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} thus also measures {D magnitude} according to {E magnitude}.
But one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} (only) measures {D magnitude} according to some (one) of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} [Prop. 9.11].
And thus {E magnitude} is the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
The very opposite thing was assumed.
Thus, {F magnitude} is not the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
Similarly, we can show that {F magnitude} is measured by {A magnitude}, (by) again showing that {F magnitude} is not prime.
For if ({F magnitude} is prime), and measures {D magnitude}, then it will also measure {A magnitude}, (despite {A magnitude}) being prime (and) not being the same as it [Prop. 9.12].
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {F magnitude} is not prime.
Thus, (it is) composite.
And every composite number is measured by some prime number [Prop. 7.31].
Thus, {F magnitude} is measured by some prime number.
So I say that it will be measured by no other prime number than {A magnitude}.
For if some other prime (number) measures {F magnitude}, and {F magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, then this (prime number) will thus also measure {D magnitude}.
Hence, it will also measure {A magnitude}, (despite {A magnitude}) being prime (and) not being the same as it [Prop. 9.12].
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {A magnitude} measures {F magnitude}.
And since {E magnitude} measures {D magnitude} according to {F magnitude}, {E magnitude} has thus made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}.
But, in fact, {A magnitude} has also made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude} [Prop. 9.11 corr.].
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude}, {C magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}.
Thus, proportionally, as {A magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
And {A magnitude} measures {E magnitude}.
Thus, {F magnitude} also measures {C magnitude}.
Let it measure it according to {G magnitude}.
So, similarly, we can show that {G magnitude} is not the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, and that it is measured by {A magnitude}.
And since {F magnitude} measures {C magnitude} according to {G magnitude}, {F magnitude} has thus made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {G magnitude}.
But, in fact, {A magnitude} has also made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude} [Prop. 9.11 corr.].
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude}, {B magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}.
Thus, proportionally, as {A magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {G magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
And {A magnitude} measures {F magnitude}.
Thus, {G magnitude} also measures {B magnitude}.
Let it measure it according to {H magnitude}.
So, similarly, we can show that {H magnitude} is not the same as {A magnitude}.
And since {G magnitude} measures {B magnitude} according to {H magnitude}, {G magnitude} has thus made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {H magnitude}.
But, in fact, {A magnitude} has also made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying itself [Prop. 9.8].
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {H magnitude}, {G magnitude} is equal to the square on {A magnitude}.
Thus, as {H magnitude} is to {A magnitude}, (so) {A magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].
And {A magnitude} measures {G magnitude}.
Thus, {H magnitude} also measures {A magnitude}, (despite {A magnitude}) being prime (and) not being the same as it.
The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, the greatest (number) {D magnitude} cannot be measured by another (number) except (one of) {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
