If an odd (number) is subtracted from an even number then the remainder will be odd.

For let the odd (number) {BC magnitude} have been subtracted from the even number {AB magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {CA magnitude} is odd.

For let the unit {CD magnitude} have been subtracted from {BC magnitude}.
{DB magnitude} is thus even [Def. 7.7].
And {AB magnitude} is also even.
And thus the remainder {AD magnitude} is even [Prop. 9.24].
And {CD magnitude} is a unit.
Thus, {CA magnitude} is odd [Def. 7.7].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
