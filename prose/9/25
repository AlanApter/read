If an odd (number) is subtracted from an even number then the remainder will be odd.

For let the odd (number) BC have been subtracted from the even number AB.
I say that the remainder CA is odd.

For let the unit CD have been subtracted from BC.
DB is thus even [Def. 7.7].
And AB is also even.
And thus the remainder AD is even [Prop. 9.24].
And CD is a unit.
Thus, CA is odd [Def. 7.7].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
