If an odd number makes some (number by) multiplying an even (number) then the created (number) will be even.

For let the odd number A make C (by) multiplying the even (number) B.
I say that C is even.

For since A has made C (by) multiplying B, C is thus composed out of so many (magnitudes) equal to B, as many as (there) are units in A [Def. 7.15].
And B is even.
Thus, C is composed out of even (numbers).
And if any multitude whatsoever of even numbers is added together then the whole is even [Prop. 9.21].
Thus, C is even.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
