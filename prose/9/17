If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continuously proportional, and the outermost of them are prime to one another, then as the first (is) to the second, so the last will not be to some other (number).

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} be any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers.
And let the outermost of them, {A magnitude} and {D magnitude}, be prime to one another.
I say that as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) not to some other (number).

For, if possible, let it be that as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.
Thus, alternately, as {A magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, (so) {B magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.13].
And {A magnitude} and {D magnitude} are prime (to one another).
And (numbers) prime (to one another are) also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as them) [Prop. 7.21].
And the least numbers measure those (numbers) having the same ratio (as them) an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [Prop. 7.20].
Thus, {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude}.
And as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, (so) {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}.
Thus, {B magnitude} also measures {C magnitude}.
And hence {A magnitude} measures {C magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
And since as {B magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, (so) {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, and {B magnitude} measures {C magnitude}, {C magnitude} thus also measures {D magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
But, {A magnitude} was (found to be) measuring {C magnitude}.
And hence {A magnitude} also measures {D magnitude}.
And ({A magnitude}) also measures itself.
Thus, {A magnitude} measures {A magnitude} and {D magnitude}, which are prime to one another.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} cannot be to some other (number).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
