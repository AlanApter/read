If an even (number) is subtracted from an(other) even number then the remainder will be even.

For let the even (number) BC have been subtracted from the even number AB.
I say that the remainder CA is even.

For since AB is even, it has a half part [Def. 7.6].
So, for the same (reasons), BC also has a half part.
And hence the remainder [CA has a half part].
[Thus,] AC is even.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
