If two numbers make a square (number by) multiplying one another then they are similar plane numbers.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be two numbers, and let {A magnitude} make the square (number) {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar plane numbers.

For let {A magnitude} make {D magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
Thus, {D magnitude} is square.
And since {A magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying itself, and has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, thus as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And since {D magnitude} is square, and {C magnitude} (is) also, {D magnitude} and {C magnitude} are thus similar plane numbers.
Thus, one (number) falls (between) {D magnitude} and {C magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.18].
And as {D magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
Thus, one (number) also falls (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.8].
And if one (number) falls (between) two numbers in mean proportion then [the] numbers are similar plane (numbers) [Prop. 8.20].
Thus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar plane (numbers).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
