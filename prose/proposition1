To construct an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight-line.

Let {AB line} be the given finite straight-line.

So it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight-line {AB line}.

Let the circle {BCD circle A} with center {A point} and radius {AB line} have been drawn [Post. 3], and again let the circle {ACE  circle B} with center {B point} and radius {BA line} have been drawn [Post. 3].
And let the straight-lines {CA line} and {CB line} have been joined from the point {C point}, where the circles cut one another, to the points {A point} and {B point} (respectively) [Post. 1].

And since the point {A point} is the center of the circle {CDB circle A}, {AC line} is equal to {AB line} [Def. 1.15].
Again, since the point {B point} is the center of the circle {CAE circle B}, {BC line} is equal to {BA line} [Def. 1.15].
But {CA line} was also shown (to be) equal to {AB line}.
Thus, {CA line} and {CB line} are each equal to {AB line}.
But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N.  1]. Thus, {CA line} is also equal to {CB line}.
Thus, the three (straight-lines) {CA line}, {AB line}, and {BC line} are equal to one another.

Thus, the triangle {ABC polygon} is equilateral, and has been constructed on the given finite straight-line {AB line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
