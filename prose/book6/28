To apply a parallelogram, equal to a given rectilinear figure, to a given straight-line, (the applied parallelogram) falling short by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given (parallelogram).
It is necessary for the given rectilinear figure not to be greater than the (parallelogram) described on half (of the straight-line) and similar to the deficit.

Let {AB line} be the given straight-line, and {C given} the given rectilinear figure to which the (parallelogram) applied to {AB line} is required (to be) equal, [being] not greater than the (parallelogram) described on half of {AB line} and similar to the deficit, and {D given} the (parallelogram) to which the deficit is required (to be) similar.
So it is required to apply a parallelogram, equal to the given rectilinear figure {C given}, to the straight-line {AB line}, falling short by a parallelogrammic figure which is similar to {D given}.

Let {AB line} have been cut in half at point {E point} [Prop. 1.10], and let (parallelogram) {EBFG polygon}, (which is) similar, and similarly laid out, to (parallelogram) {D given}, have been described on {EB line} [Prop. 6.18].
And let parallelogram {AEGH polygon} have been completed.

Therefore, if {AEGH polygon} is equal to {C given} then the thing prescribed has happened.
For a parallelogram {AEGH polygon}, equal to the given rectilinear figure {C given}, has been applied to the given straight-line {AB line}, falling short by a parallelogrammic figure {GEBF polygon} which is similar to {D given}.
And if not, let {HAEG polygon} be greater than {C given}.
And {HAEG polygon} (is) equal to {GEBF polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {GEBF polygon} (is) also greater than {C given}.
So, let (parallelogram) {KLMN polygon} have been constructed (so as to be) both similar, and similarly laid out, to {D given}, and equal to the excess by which {GEBF polygon} is greater than {C given} [Prop. 6.25].
But, {GEBF polygon} [is] similar to {D given}.
Thus, {KLMN polygon} is also similar to {GEBF polygon} [Prop. 6.21].
Therefore, let {KL line} correspond to {GE line}, and {LM line} to {GF line}.
And since (parallelogram) {GEBF polygon} is equal to (figure) {C given} and (parallelogram) {KLMN polygon}, {GEBF polygon} is thus greater than {KLMN polygon}.
Thus, {GE line} is also greater than {KL line}, and {GF line} than {LM line}.
Let {GO line} be made equal to {KL line}, and {GP line} to {LM line} [Prop. 1.3].
And let the parallelogram {OGPQ polygon} have been completed.
Thus, {GOQP polygon} is equal and similar to {KLMN polygon}.
Thus, {GOQP polygon} is also similar to {GEBF polygon} [Prop. 6.21].
Thus, {GOQP polygon} and {GEBF polygon} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].
Let {GQB line} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (remainder of the) figure have been described.

Therefore, since {BFGE polygon} is equal to {C given} and {KLMN polygon}, of which {GOQP polygon} is equal to {KLMN polygon}, the remaining gnomon {VWU given} is thus equal to the remainder {C given}.
And since (the complement) {PQRF polygon} is equal to (the complement) {OESQ polygon} [Prop. 1.43], let (parallelogram) {QSBR polygon} have been added to both.
Thus, the whole (parallelogram) {PSBF polygon} is equal to the whole (parallelogram) {OEBR polygon}.
But, {OEBR polygon} is equal to {TAEO polygon}, since side {AE line} is equal to side {EB line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {TAEO polygon} is also equal to {PSBF polygon}.
Let (parallelogram) {OESQ polygon} have been added to both.
Thus, the whole (parallelogram) {TASQ polygon} is equal to the gnomon {VWU given}.
But, gnomon {VWU given} was shown (to be) equal to {C given}.
Therefore, (parallelogram) {TASQ polygon} is also equal to (figure) {C given}.

Thus, the parallelogram {SQTA polygon}, equal to the given rectilinear figure {C given}, has been applied to the given straight-line {AB line}, falling short by the parallelogrammic figure {QSBR polygon}, which is similar to {D given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
