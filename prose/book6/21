(Rectilinear figures) similar to the same rectilinear figure are also similar to one another.

Let each of the rectilinear figures A and B be similar to (the rectilinear figure) C.
I say that A is also similar to B.

For since A is similar to C, (A) is equiangular to (C), and has the sides about the equal angles proportional [Def. 6.1].
Again, since B is similar to C, (B) is equiangular to (C), and has the sides about the equal angles proportional [Def. 6.1].
Thus, A and B are each equiangular to C, and have the sides about the equal angles proportional [hence, A is also equiangular to B, and has the sides about the equal angles proportional].
Thus, A is similar to B [Def. 6.1].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
