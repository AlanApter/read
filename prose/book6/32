If two triangles, having two sides proportional to two sides, are placed together at a single angle such that the corresponding sides are also parallel, then the remaining sides of the triangles will be straight-on (with respect to one another).

Let ABC and DCE be two triangles having the two sides BA and AC proportional to the two sides DC and DE---so that as AB (is) to AC, so DC (is) to DE---and (having side) AB parallel to DC, and AC to DE. I say that (side) BC is straight-on to CE.

For since AB is parallel to DC, and the straight-line AC has fallen across them, the alternate angles BAC and ACD are equal to one another [Prop. 1.29]. So, for the same (reasons), CDE is also equal to ACD. And, hence, BAC is equal to CDE. And since ABC and DCE are two triangles having the one angle at A equal to the one angle at D, and the sides about the equal angles proportional, (so that) as BA (is) to AC, so CD (is) to DE, triangle ABC is thus equiangular to triangle DCE [Prop. 6.6]. Thus, angle ABC is equal to DCE. And (angle) ACD was also shown (to be) equal to BAC. Thus, the whole (angle) ACE is equal to the two (angles) ABC and BAC. Let ACB have been added to both. Thus, ACE and ACB are equal to BAC, ACB, and CBA. But, BAC, ABC, and ACB are equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, ACE and ACB are also equal to two right-angles. Thus, the two straight-lines BC and CE, not lying on the same side, make adjacent angles ACE and ACB (whose sum is) equal to two right-angles with some straight-line AC, at the point C on it. Thus, BC is straight-on to CE [Prop. 1.14].

Thus, if two triangles, having two sides proportional to two sides, are placed together at a single angle such that the corresponding sides are also parallel, then the remaining sides of the triangles will be straight-on (with respect to one another). (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
