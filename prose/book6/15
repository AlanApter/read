In equal triangles also having one angle equal to one (angle) the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
And those triangles having one angle equal to one angle for which the sides about the equal angles (are) reciprocally proportional are equal.

Let {ABC polygon} and {ADE polygon} be equal triangles having one angle equal to one (angle), (namely) {BAC angle} (equal) to {DAE angle}.
I say that, in triangles {ABC polygon} and {ADE polygon}, the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that as {CA line} is to {AD line}, so {EA line} (is) to {AB line}.

For let {CA line} be laid down so as to be straight-on (with respect) to {AD line}.
Thus, {EA line} is also straight-on (with respect) to {AB line} [Prop. 1.14].
And let {BD line} have been joined.

Therefore, since triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {ADE polygon}, and {BAD polygon} (is) some other (triangle), thus as triangle {CAB polygon} is to triangle {BAD polygon}, so triangle {EAD polygon} (is) to triangle {BAD polygon} [Prop. 5.7].
But, as (triangle) {CAB polygon} (is) to {BAD polygon}, so {CA line} (is) to {AD line}, and as (triangle) {EAD polygon} (is) to {BAD polygon}, so {EA line} (is) to {AB line} [Prop. 6.1].
And thus, as {CA line} (is) to {AD line}, so {EA line} (is) to {AB line}.
Thus, in triangles {ABC polygon} and {ADE polygon} the sides about the equal angles (are) reciprocally proportional.

And so, let the sides of triangles {ABC polygon} and {ADE polygon} be reciprocally proportional, and (thus) let {CA line} be to {AD line}, as {EA line} (is) to {AB line}.
I say that triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {ADE polygon}.

For, {BD line} again being joined, since as {CA line} is to {AD line}, so {EA line} (is) to {AB line}, but as {CA line} (is) to {AD line}, so triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to triangle {BAD polygon}, and as {EA line} (is) to {AB line}, so triangle {EAD polygon} (is) to triangle {BAD polygon} [Prop. 6.1], thus as triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to triangle {BAD polygon}, so triangle {EAD polygon} (is) to triangle {BAD polygon}.
Thus, (triangles) {ABC polygon} and {EAD polygon} each have the same ratio to {BAD polygon}.
Thus, [triangle] {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {EAD polygon} [Prop. 5.9].

Thus, in equal triangles also having one angle equal to one (angle) the sides about the equal angles (are) reciprocally proportional.
And those triangles having one angle equal to one angle for which the sides about the equal angles (are) reciprocally proportional are equal.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
