To describe a rectilinear figure similar, and similarly laid down, to a given rectilinear figure on a given straight-line.

Let AB be the given straight-line, and CE the given rectilinear figure. So it is required to describe a rectilinear figure similar, and similarly laid down, to the rectilinear figure CE on the straight-line AB.

Let DF have been joined, and let GAB, equal to the angle at C, and ABG, equal to (angle) CDF, have been constructed on the straight-line AB at the points A and B on it (respectively) [Prop. 1.23]. Thus, the remaining (angle) CFD is equal to AGB [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, triangle FCD is equiangular to triangle GAB. Thus, proportionally, as FD is to GB, so FC (is) to GA, and CD to AB [Prop. 6.4]. Again, let BGH, equal to angle DFE, and GBH equal to (angle) FDE, have been constructed on the straight-line BG at the points G and B on it (respectively) [Prop. 1.23]. Thus, the remaining (angle) at E is equal to the remaining (angle) at H [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, triangle FDE is equiangular to triangle GHB. Thus, proportionally, as FD is to GB, so FE (is) to GH, and ED to HB [Prop.6.4]. And it was also shown (that) as FD (is) to GB, so FC (is) to GA, and CD to AB. Thus, also, as FC (is) to AG, so CD (is) to AB, and FE to GH, and, further, ED to HB. And since angle CFD is equal to AGB, and DFE to BGH, thus the whole (angle) CFE is equal to the whole (angle) AGH. So, for the same (reasons), (angle) CDE is also equal to ABH. And the (angle) at C is also equal to the (angle) at A, and the (angle) at E to the (angle) at H. Thus, (figure) AH is equiangular to CE. And (the two figures) have the sides about their equal angles proportional. Thus, the rectilinear figure AH is similar to the rectilinear figure CE [Def. 6.1].

Thus, the rectilinear figure AH, similar, and similarly laid down, to the given rectilinear figure CE has been constructed on the given straight-line AB. (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
