To construct a single (rectilinear figure) similar to a given rectilinear figure, and equal to a different given rectilinear figure.

Let {ABC polygon} be the given rectilinear figure to which it is required to construct a similar (rectilinear figure), and {D given} the (rectilinear figure) to which (the constructed figure) is required (to be) equal.
So it is required to construct a single (rectilinear figure) similar to {ABC polygon}, and equal to {D given}.

For let the parallelogram {BLEC polygon}, equal to triangle {ABC polygon}, have been applied to (the straight-line) {BC line} [Prop. 1.44], and the parallelogram {CEMF polygon}, equal to {D given}, (have been applied) to (the straight-line) {CE line}, in the angle {FCE angle}, which is equal to {CBL angle} [Prop. 1.45].
Thus, {BC line} is straight-on to {CF line}, and {LE line} to {EM line} [Prop. 1.14].
And let the mean proportion {GH line} have been taken of {BC line} and {CF line} [Prop. 6.13].
And let {KGH polygon}, similar, and similarly laid out, to {ABC polygon} have been described on {GH line} [Prop. 6.18].

And since as {BC line} is to {GH line}, so {GH line} (is) to {CF line}, and if three straight-lines are proportional then as the first is to the third, so the figure (described) on the first (is) to the similar, and similarly described, (figure) on the second [Prop. 6.19 corr.], thus as {BC line} is to {CF line}, so triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to triangle {KGH polygon}.
But, also, as {BC line} (is) to {CF line}, so parallelogram {BLEC polygon} (is) to parallelogram {EMFC polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
And, thus, as triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to triangle {KGH polygon}, so parallelogram {BLEC polygon} (is) to parallelogram {EMFC polygon}.
Thus, alternately, as triangle {ABC polygon} (is) to parallelogram {BLEC polygon}, so triangle {KGH polygon} (is) to parallelogram {EMFC polygon} [Prop. 5.16].
And triangle {ABC polygon} (is) equal to parallelogram {BLEC polygon}.
Thus, triangle {KGH polygon} (is) also equal to parallelogram {EMFC polygon}.
But, parallelogram {EMFC polygon} is equal to {D given}.
Thus, {KGH polygon} is also equal to {D given}.
And {KGH polygon} is also similar to {ABC polygon}.

Thus, a single (rectilinear figure) {KGH polygon} has been constructed (which is) similar to the given rectilinear figure {ABC polygon}, and equal to a different given (rectilinear figure) {D given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
