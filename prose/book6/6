If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, and the sides about the equal angles proportional, then the triangles will be equiangular, and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be two triangles having one angle, {BAC angle}, equal to one angle, {EDF angle} (respectively), and the sides about the equal angles proportional, (so that) as {BA line} (is) to {AC line}, so {ED line} (is) to {DF line}.
I say that triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to triangle {DEF polygon}, and will have angle {ABC angle} equal to {DEF angle}, and (angle) {ACB angle} to {DFE angle}.

For let (angle) {FDG angle}, equal to each of {BAC angle} and {EDF angle}, and (angle) {DFG angle}, equal to {ACB angle}, have been constructed on the straight-line {DF line} at the points {D point} and {F point} on it (respectively) [Prop. 1.23].
Thus, the remaining angle at {B point} is equal to the remaining angle at {G point} [Prop. 1.32].

Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to triangle {DGF polygon}.
Thus, proportionally, as {BA line} (is) to {AC line}, so {GD line} (is) to {DF line} [Prop. 6.4].
And it was also assumed that as {BA line} is) to {AC line}, so {ED line} (is) to {DF line}.
And, thus, as {ED line} (is) to {DF line}, so {GD line} (is) to {DF line} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, {ED line} (is) equal to {DG line} [Prop. 5.9].
And {DF line} (is) common.
So, the two (sides) {ED line}, {DF line} are equal to the two (sides) {GD line}, {DF line} (respectively).
And angle {EDF angle} [is] equal to angle {GDF angle}.
Thus, base {EF line} is equal to base {GF line}, and triangle {DEF polygon} is equal to triangle {GDF polygon}, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles which the equal sides subtend [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, (angle) {DFG angle} is equal to {DFE angle}, and (angle) {DGF angle} to {DEF angle}.
But, (angle) {DFG angle} is equal to {ACB angle}.
Thus, (angle) {ACB angle} is also equal to {DFE angle}.
And (angle) {BAC angle} was also assumed (to be) equal to {EDF angle}.
Thus, the remaining (angle) at {B point} is equal to the remaining (angle) at {E point} [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to triangle {DEF polygon}.

Thus, if two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, and the sides about the equal angles proportional, then the triangles will be equiangular, and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
