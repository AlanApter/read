If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, and the sides about the equal angles proportional, then the triangles will be equiangular, and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal.

Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having one angle, BAC, equal to one angle, EDF (respectively), and the sides about the equal angles proportional, (so that) as BA (is) to AC, so ED (is) to DF. I say that triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF, and will have angle ABC equal to DEF, and (angle) ACB to DFE.

For let (angle) FDG, equal to each of BAC and EDF, and (angle) DFG, equal to ACB, have been constructed on the straight-line AF at the points D and F on it (respectively) [Prop. 1.23]. Thus, the remaining angle at B is equal to the remaining angle at G [Prop. 1.32].

Thus, triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DGF. Thus, proportionally, as BA (is) to AC, so GD (is) to DF [Prop. 6.4]. And it was also assumed that as BA is) to AC, so ED (is) to DF. And, thus, as ED (is) to DF, so GD (is) to DF [Prop. 5.11]. Thus, ED (is) equal to DG [Prop. 5.9]. And DF (is) common. So, the two (sides) ED, DF are equal to the two (sides) GD, DF (respectively). And angle EDF [is] equal to angle GDF. Thus, base EF is equal to base GF, and triangle DEF is equal to triangle GDF, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles which the equal sides subtend [Prop. 1.4]. Thus, (angle) DFG is equal to DFE, and (angle) DGF to DEF. But, (angle) DFG is equal to ACB. Thus, (angle) ACB is also equal to DFE. And (angle) BAC was also assumed (to be) equal to EDF. Thus, the remaining (angle) at B is equal to the remaining (angle) at E [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF.

Thus, if two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, and the sides about the equal angles proportional, then the triangles will be equiangular, and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
