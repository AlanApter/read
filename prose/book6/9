To cut off a prescribed part from a given straight-line.

Let AB be the given straight-line. So it is required to cut off a prescribed part from AB.

So let a third (part) have been prescribed. [And] let some straight-line AC have been drawn from (point) A, encompassing a random angle with AB. And let a random point D have been taken on AC. And let DE and EC be made equal to AD [Prop. 1.3]. And let BC have been joined. And let DF have been drawn through D parallel to it [Prop. 1.31].

Therefore, since FD has been drawn parallel to one of the sides, BC, of triangle ABC, then, proportionally, as CD is to DA, so BF (is) to FA [Prop. 6.2]. And CD (is) double DA. Thus, BF (is) also double FA. Thus, BA (is) triple AF.

Thus, the prescribed third part, AF, has been cut off from the given straight-line, AB. (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
