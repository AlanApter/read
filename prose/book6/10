To cut a given uncut straight-line similarly to a given cut (straight-line).

Let {AB line} be the given uncut straight-line, and {AC line} a (straight-line) cut at points {D point} and {E point}, and let ({AC line}) be laid down so as to encompass a random angle (with {AB line}).
And let {CB line} have been joined.
And let {DF line} and {EG line} have been drawn through (points) {D point} and {E point} (respectively), parallel to {BC line}, and let {DHK line} have been drawn through (point) {D point}, parallel to {AB line} [Prop. 1.31].

Thus, {DFGH polygon} and {KHGB polygon} are each parallelograms.
Thus, {DH line} (is) equal to {FG line}, and {HK line} to {GB line} [Prop. 1.34].
And since the straight-line {HE line} has been drawn parallel to one of the sides, {KC line}, of triangle {DKC polygon}, thus, proportionally, as {CE line} is to {ED line}, so {KH line} (is) to {HD line} [Prop. 6.2].
And {KH line} (is) equal to {BG line}, and {HD line} to {GF line}.
Thus, as {CE line} is to {ED line}, so {BG line} (is) to {GF line}.
Again, since {FD line} has been drawn parallel to one of the sides, {GE line}, of triangle {AGE polygon}, thus, proportionally, as {ED line} is to {DA line}, so {GF line} (is) to {FA line} [Prop. 6.2].
And it was also shown that as {CE line} (is) to {ED line}, so {BG line} (is) to {GF line}.
Thus, as {CE line} is to {ED line}, so {BG line} (is) to {GF line}, and as {ED line} (is) to {DA line}, so {GF line} (is) to {FA line}.

Thus, the given uncut straight-line, {AB line}, has been cut similarly to the given cut straight-line, {AC line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
