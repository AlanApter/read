To find a fourth (straight-line) proportional to three given straight-lines.

Let A, B, and C be the three given straight-lines. So it is required to find a fourth (straight-line) proportional to A, B, and C.

Let the two straight-lines DE and DF be set out encompassing the [random] angle EDF. And let DG be made equal to A, and GE to B, and, further, DH to C [Prop. 1.3]. And GH being joined, let EF have been drawn through (point) E parallel to it [Prop. 1.31].

Therefore, since GH has been drawn parallel to one of the sides EF of triangle DEF, thus as DG is to GE, so DH (is) to HF [Prop. 6.2]. And DG (is) equal to A, and GE to B, and DH to C. Thus, as A is to B, so C (is) to HF.

Thus, a fourth (straight-line), HF, has been found (which is) proportional to the three given straight-lines, A, B, and C.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
