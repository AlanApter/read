If, in a right-angled triangle, a (straight-line) is drawn from the right-angle perpendicular to the base then the triangles around the perpendicular are similar to the whole (triangle), and to one another.

Let {ABC polygon} be a right-angled triangle having the angle {BAC angle} a right-angle, and let {AD line} have been drawn from {A point}, perpendicular to {BC line} [Prop. 1.12].
I say that triangles {ABD polygon} and {ADC polygon} are each similar to the whole (triangle) {ABC polygon} and, further, to one another.

For since (angle) {BAC angle} is equal to {ADB angle}---for each (are) right-angles---and the (angle) at {B point} (is) common to the two triangles {ABC polygon} and {ABD polygon}, the remaining (angle) {ACB angle} is thus equal to the remaining (angle) {BAD angle} [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to triangle {ABD polygon}.
Thus, as {BC line}, subtending the right-angle in triangle {ABC polygon}, is to {BA line}, subtending the right-angle in triangle {ABD polygon}, so the same {AB line}, subtending the angle at {C point} in triangle {ABC polygon}, (is) to {BD line}, subtending the equal (angle) {BAD angle} in triangle {ABD polygon}, and, further, (so is) {AC line} to {AD line}, (both) subtending the angle at {B point} common to the two triangles [Prop. 6.4].
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equiangular to triangle {ABD polygon}, and has the sides about the equal angles proportional.
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} [is] similar to triangle {ABD polygon} [Def. 6.1].
So, similarly, we can show that triangle {ABC polygon} is also similar to triangle {ADC polygon}.
Thus, [triangles] {ABD polygon} and {ADC polygon} are each similar to the whole (triangle) {ABC polygon}.

So I say that triangles {ABD polygon} and {ADC polygon} are also similar to one another.

For since the right-angle {BDA angle} is equal to the right-angle {ADC angle}, and, indeed, (angle) {BAD angle} was also shown (to be) equal to the (angle) at {C point}, thus the remaining (angle) at {B point} is also equal to the remaining (angle) {DAC angle} [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, triangle {ABD polygon} is equiangular to triangle {ADC polygon}.
Thus, as {BD line}, subtending (angle) {BAD angle} in triangle {ABD polygon}, is to {DA line}, subtending the (angle) at {C point} in triangle {ADC polygon}, (which is) equal to (angle) {BAD angle}, so (is) the same {AD line}, subtending the angle at {B point} in triangle {ABD polygon}, to {DC line}, subtending (angle) {DAC angle} in triangle {ADC polygon}, (which is) equal to the (angle) at {B point}, and, further, (so is) {BA line} to {AC line}, (each) subtending right-angles [Prop. 6.4].
Thus, triangle {ABD polygon} is similar to triangle {ADC polygon} [Def. 6.1].

Thus, if, in a right-angled triangle, a (straight-line) is drawn from the right-angle perpendicular to the base then the triangles around the perpendicular are similar to the whole (triangle), and to one another.
[(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.]

Corollary

So (it is) clear, from this, that if, in a right-angled triangle, a (straight-line) is drawn from the right-angle perpendicular to the base then the (straight-line so) drawn is in mean proportion to the pieces of the base.
(which is) the very thing it was required to show.
