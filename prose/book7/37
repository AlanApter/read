If a number is measured by some number then the (number) measured will have a part called the same as the measuring (number).

For let the number A be measured by some number B.
I say that A has a part called the same as B.

For as many times as B measures A, so many units let there be in C.
Since B measures A according to the units in C, and the unit D also measures C according to the units in it, the unit D thus measures the number C as many times as B (measures) A.
Thus, alternately, the unit D measures the number B as many times as C (measures) A [Prop. 7.15].
Thus, which(ever) part the unit D is of the number B, C is also the same part of A.
And the unit D is a part of the number B called the same as it (i.e., a Bth part).
Thus, C is also a part of A called the same as B (i.e., C is the Bth part of A).
Hence, A has a part C which is called the same as B (i.e., A has a Bth part).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
