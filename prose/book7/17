If a number multiplying two numbers makes some (numbers) then the (numbers) generated from them will have the same ratio as the multiplied (numbers).

For let the number {A magnitude} make (the numbers) {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} (by) multiplying the two numbers {B magnitude} and {C magnitude} (respectively).
I say that as {B magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.

For since {A magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude}, {B magnitude} thus measures {D magnitude} according to the units in {A magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
And the unit {F magnitude} also measures the number {A magnitude} according to the units in it.
Thus, the unit {F magnitude} measures the number {A magnitude} as many times as {B magnitude} (measures) {D magnitude}.
Thus, as the unit {F magnitude} is to the number {A magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
And so, for the same (reasons), as the unit {F magnitude} (is) to the number {A magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.
And thus, as {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.
Thus, alternately, as {B magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.13].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
