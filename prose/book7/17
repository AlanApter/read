If a number multiplying two numbers makes some (numbers) then the (numbers) generated from them will have the same ratio as the multiplied (numbers).

For let the number A make (the numbers) D and E (by) multiplying the two numbers B and C (respectively).
I say that as B is to C, so D (is) to E.

For since A has made D (by) multiplying B, B thus measures D according to the units in A [Def. 7.15].
And the unit F also measures the number A according to the units in it.
Thus, the unit F measures the number A as many times as B (measures) D.
Thus, as the unit F is to the number A, so B (is) to D [Def. 7.20].
And so, for the same (reasons), as the unit F (is) to the number A, so C (is) to E.
And thus, as B (is) to D, so C (is) to E.
Thus, alternately, as B is to C, so D (is) to E [Prop. 7.13].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
