To find the least number that will have given parts.

Let A, B, and C be the given parts.
So it is required to find the least number which will have the parts A, B, and C (i.e., an Ath part, a Bth part, and a Cth part).

For let D, E, and F be numbers having the same names as the parts A, B, and C (respectively).
And let the least number, G, measured by D, E, and F, have been taken [Prop. 7.36].

Thus, G has parts called the same as D, E, and F [Prop. 7.37].
And A, B, and C are parts called the same as D, E, and F (respectively).
Thus, G has the parts A, B, and C.
So I say that (G) is also the least (number having the parts A, B, and C).
For if not, there will be some number less than G which will have the parts A, B, and C.
Let it be H.
Since H has the parts A, B, and C, H will thus be measured by numbers called the same as the parts A, B, and C [Prop. 7.38].
And D, E, and F are numbers called the same as the parts A, B, and C (respectively).
Thus, H is measured by D, E, and F.
And (H) is less than G.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, there cannot be some number less than G which will have the parts A, B, and C.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
