If a number is those parts of a number that a (part) taken away (is) of a (part) taken away then the remainder will also be the same parts of the remainder that the whole (is) of the whole.

For let a number {AB magnitude} be those parts of a number {CD magnitude} that a (part) taken away {AE magnitude} (is) of a (part) taken away {CF magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {EB magnitude} is also the same parts of the remainder {FD magnitude} that the whole {AB magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude}.

For let {GH magnitude} be laid down equal to {AB magnitude}.
Thus, which(ever) parts {GH magnitude} is of {CD magnitude}, {AE magnitude} is also the same parts of {CF magnitude}.
Let {GH magnitude} have been divided into the parts of {CD magnitude}, {GK magnitude} and {KH magnitude}, and {AE magnitude} into the part of {CF magnitude}, {AL magnitude} and {LE magnitude}.
So the multitude of (divisions) {GK magnitude}, {KH magnitude} will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) {AL magnitude}, {LE magnitude}.
And since which(ever) part {GK magnitude} is of {CD magnitude}, {AL magnitude} is also the same part of {CF magnitude}, and {CD magnitude} (is) greater than {CF magnitude}, {GK magnitude} (is) thus also greater than {AL magnitude}.
Let {GM magnitude} be made equal to {AL magnitude}.
Thus, which(ever) part {GK magnitude} is of {CD magnitude}, {GM magnitude} is also the same part of {CF magnitude}.
Thus, the remainder {MK magnitude} is also the same part of the remainder {FD magnitude} that the whole {GK magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude} [Prop. 7.5].
Again, since which(ever) part {KH magnitude} is of {CD magnitude}, {EL magnitude} is also the same part of {CF magnitude}, and {CD magnitude} (is) greater than {CF magnitude}, {HK magnitude} (is) thus also greater than {EL magnitude}.
Let {KN magnitude} be made equal to {EL magnitude}.
Thus, which(ever) part {KH magnitude} (is) of {CD magnitude}, {KN magnitude} is also the same part of {CF magnitude}.
Thus, the remainder {NH magnitude} is also the same part of the remainder {FD magnitude} that the whole {KH magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude} [Prop. 7.5].
And the remainder {MK magnitude} was also shown to be the same part of the remainder {FD magnitude} that the whole {GK magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude}.
Thus, the sum {MK magnitude}, {NH magnitude} is the same parts of {DF magnitude} that the whole {HG magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude}.
And the sum {MK magnitude}, {NH magnitude} (is) equal to {EB magnitude}, and {HG magnitude} to {BA magnitude}.
Thus, the remainder {EB magnitude} is also the same parts of the remainder {FD magnitude} that the whole {AB magnitude} (is) of the whole {CD magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
