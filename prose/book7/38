If a number has any part whatever then it will be measured by a number called the same as the part.

For let the number A have any part whatever, B.
And let the [number] C be called the same as the part B (i.e., B is the Cth part of A).
I say that C measures A.

For since B is a part of A called the same as C, and the unit D is also a part of C called the same as it (i.e.,

D is the Cth part of C), thus which(ever) part the unit D is of the number C, B is also the same part of A.
Thus, the unit D measures the number C as many times as B (measures) A.
Thus, alternately, the unit D measures the number B as many times as C (measures) A [Prop. 7.15].
Thus, C measures A.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
