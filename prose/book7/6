If a number is parts of a number, and another (number) is the same parts of another, then the sum (of the leading numbers) will also be the same parts of the sum (of the following numbers) that one (number) is of another.

For let a number {AB magnitude} be parts of a number {C magnitude}, and another (number) {DE magnitude} (be) the same parts of another (number) {F magnitude} that {AB magnitude} (is) of {C magnitude}.
I say that the sum {AB magnitude}, {DE magnitude} is also the same parts of the sum {C magnitude}, {F magnitude} that {AB magnitude} (is) of {C magnitude}.

For since which(ever) parts {AB magnitude} is of {C magnitude}, {DE magnitude} (is) also the same parts of {F magnitude}, thus as many parts of {C magnitude} as are in {AB magnitude}, so many parts of {F magnitude} are also in {DE magnitude}.
Let {AB magnitude} have been divided into the parts of {C magnitude}, {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, and {DE magnitude} into the parts of {F magnitude}, {DH magnitude} and {HE magnitude}.
So the multitude of (divisions) {AG magnitude}, {GB magnitude} will be equal to the multitude of (divisions) {DH magnitude}, {HE magnitude}.
And since which(ever) part {AG magnitude} is of {C magnitude}, {DH magnitude} is also the same part of {F magnitude}, thus which(ever) part {AG magnitude} is of {C magnitude}, the sum {AG magnitude}, {DH magnitude} is also the same part of the sum {C magnitude}, {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.5].
And so, for the same (reasons), which(ever) part {GB magnitude} is of {C magnitude}, the sum {GB magnitude}, {HE magnitude} is also the same part of the sum {C magnitude}, {F magnitude}.
Thus, which(ever) parts {AB magnitude} is of {C magnitude}, the sum {AB magnitude}, {DE magnitude} is also the same parts of the sum {C magnitude}, {F magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
