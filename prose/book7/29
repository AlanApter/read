Every prime number is prime to every number which it does not measure.

Let A be a prime number, and let it not measure B.
I say that B and A are prime to one another.
For if B and A are not prime to one another then some number will measure them.
Let C measure (them).
Since C measures B, and A does not measure B, C is thus not the same as A.
And since C measures B and A, it thus also measures A, which is prime, (despite) not being the same as it.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some number cannot measure (both) B and A.
Thus, A and B are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
