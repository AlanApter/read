If two numbers are both prime to each of two numbers then the (numbers) created from (multiplying) them will also be prime to one another.

For let two numbers, A and B, both be prime to each of two numbers, C and D.
And let A make E (by) multiplying B, and let C make F (by) multiplying D.
I say that E and F are prime to one another.

For since A and B are each prime to C, the (number) created from (multiplying) A and B will thus also be prime to C [Prop. 7.24].
And E is the (number) created from (multiplying) A and B.
Thus, E and C are prime to one another.
So, for the same (reasons), E and D are also prime to one another.
Thus, C and D are each prime to E.
Thus, the (number) created from (multiplying) C and D will also be prime to E [Prop. 7.24].
And F is the (number) created from (multiplying) C and D.
Thus, E and F are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
