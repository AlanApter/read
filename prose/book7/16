If two numbers multiplying one another make some (numbers) then the (numbers) generated from them will be equal to one another.

Let A and B be two numbers.
And let A make C (by) multiplying B, and let B make D (by) multiplying A.
I say that C is equal to D.

For since A has made C (by) multiplying B, B thus measures C according to the units in A [Def. 7.15].
And the unit E also measures the number A according to the units in it.
Thus, the unit E measures the number A as many times as B (measures) C.
Thus, alternately, the unit E measures the number B as many times as A (measures) C [Prop. 7.15].
Again, since B has made D (by) multiplying A, A thus measures D according to the units in B [Def. 7.15].
And the unit E also measures B according to the units in it.
Thus, the unit E measures the number B as many times as A (measures) D.
And the unit E was measuring the number B as many times as A (measures) C.
Thus, A measures each of C and D an equal number of times.
Thus, C is equal to D.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
