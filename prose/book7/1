Two unequal numbers (being) laid down, and the lesser being continually subtracted, in turn, from the greater, if the remainder never measures the (number) preceding it, until a unit remains, then the original numbers will be prime to one another.

For two [unequal] numbers, {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}, the lesser being continually subtracted, in turn, from the greater, let the remainder never measure the (number) preceding it, until a unit remains.
I say that {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are prime to one another---that is to say, that a unit alone measures (both) {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}.

For if {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are not prime to one another then some number will measure them.
Let (some number) measure them, and let it be {E magnitude}.
And let {CD magnitude} measuring {BF magnitude} leave {FA magnitude} less than itself, and let {AF magnitude} measuring {DG magnitude} leave {GC magnitude} less than itself, and let {GC magnitude} measuring {FH magnitude} leave a unit, {HA magnitude}.

In fact, since {E magnitude} measures {CD magnitude}, and {CD magnitude} measures {BF magnitude}, {E magnitude} thus also measures {BF magnitude}.
And ({E magnitude}) also measures the whole of {BA magnitude}.
Thus, ({E magnitude}) will also measure the remainder {AF magnitude}.
And {AF magnitude} measures {DG magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} also measures {DG magnitude}.
And ({E magnitude}) also measures the whole of {DC magnitude}.
Thus, ({E magnitude}) will also measure the remainder {CG magnitude}.
And {CG magnitude} measures {FH magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} also measures {FH magnitude}.
And ({E magnitude}) also measures the whole of {FA magnitude}.
Thus, ({E magnitude}) will also measure the remaining unit {AH magnitude}, (despite) being a number.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some number does not measure (both) the numbers {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude}.
Thus, {AB magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
