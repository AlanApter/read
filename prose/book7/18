If two numbers multiplying some number make some (other numbers) then the (numbers) generated from them will have the same ratio as the multiplying (numbers).

For let the two numbers A and B make (the numbers) D and E (respectively, by) multiplying some number C.
I say that as A is to B, so D (is) to E.

For since A has made D (by) multiplying C, C has thus also made D (by) multiplying A [Prop. 7.16].
So, for the same (reasons), C has also made E (by) multiplying B.
So the number C has made D and E (by) multiplying the two numbers A and B (respectively).
Thus, as A is to B, so D (is) to E [Prop. 7.17].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
