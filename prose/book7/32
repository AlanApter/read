Every number is either prime or is measured by some prime number.

Let {A magnitude} be a number.
I say that {A magnitude} is either prime or is measured by some prime number.

In fact, if {A magnitude} is prime then that which was prescribed has happened.
And if (it is) composite then some prime number will measure it [Prop. 7.31].

Thus, every number is either prime or is measured by some prime number.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
