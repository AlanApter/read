If two numbers (both) measure some number then the least (number) measured by them will also measure the same (number).

For let two numbers, A and B, (both) measure some number CD, and (let) E (be the) least (number measured by both A and B).
I say that E also measures CD.

For if E does not measure CD then let E leave CF less than itself (in) measuring DF.
And since A and B (both) measure E, and E measures DF, A and B will thus also measure DF.
And (A and B) also measure the whole of CD.
Thus, they will also measure the remainder CF, which is less than E.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, E cannot not measure CD.
Thus, (E) measures (CD).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
