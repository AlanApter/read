If as the whole (of a number) is to the whole (of another), so a (part) taken away (is) to a (part) taken away, then the remainder will also be to the remainder as the whole (is) to the whole.

Let the whole {AB magnitude} be to the whole {CD magnitude} as the (part) taken away {AE magnitude} (is) to the (part) taken away {CF magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {EB magnitude} is to the remainder {FD magnitude} as the whole {AB magnitude} (is) to the whole {CD magnitude}.

(For) since as {AB magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, so {AE magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude}, thus which(ever) part, or parts, {AB magnitude} is of {CD magnitude}, {AE magnitude} is also the same part, or the same parts, of {CF magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
Thus, the remainder {EB magnitude} is also the same part, or parts, of the remainder {FD magnitude} that {AB magnitude} (is) of {CD magnitude} [Props. 7.7, 7.8].
Thus, as {EB magnitude} is to {FD magnitude}, so {AB magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
