The least numbers of those (numbers) having the same ratio as them are prime to one another.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be the least numbers of those (numbers) having the same ratio as them.
I say that {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are prime to one another.

For if they are not prime to one another then some number will measure them.
Let it (so measure them), and let it be {C magnitude}.
And as many times as {C magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, so many units let there be in {D magnitude}.
And as many times as {C magnitude} measures {B magnitude}, so many units let there be in {E magnitude}.

Since {C magnitude} measures {A magnitude} according to the units in {D magnitude}, {C magnitude} has thus made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
So, for the same (reasons), {C magnitude} has also made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}.
So the number {C magnitude} has made {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (by) multiplying the two numbers {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, as {D magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
Thus, {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} are in the same ratio as {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, being less than them.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some number does not measure the numbers {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are prime to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
