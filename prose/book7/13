If four numbers are proportional then they will also be proportional alternately.

Let the four numbers A, B, C, and D be proportional, (such that) as A (is) to B, so C (is) to D.
I say that they will also be proportional alternately, (such that) as A (is) to C, so B (is) to D.

For since as A is to B, so C (is) to D, thus which(ever) part, or parts, A is of B, C is also the same part, or the same parts, of D [Def. 7.20].
Thus, alterately, which (ever) part, or parts, A is of C, B is also the same part, or the same parts, of D [Props. 7.9, 7.10].
Thus, as A is to C, so B (is) to D [Def. 7.20].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
