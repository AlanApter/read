To apply a parallelogram equal to a given triangle to a given straight-line in a given rectilinear angle.

Let {AB line} be the given straight-line, {C given} the given triangle, and {D given} the given rectilinear angle.
So it is required to apply a parallelogram equal to the given triangle {C given} to the given straight-line {AB line} in an angle equal to {D given}.

Let the parallelogram {BEFG polygon}, equal to the triangle {C given}, have been constructed in the angle {EBG angle}, which is equal to {D given} [Prop. 1.42].
And let it have been placed so that {BE line} is straight-on to {AB line}.
And let {FG line} have been drawn through to {H point}, and let {AH line} have been drawn through {A point} parallel to either of {BG line} or {EF line} [Prop. 1.31], and let {HB line} have been joined.
And since the straight-line {HF line} falls across the parallel-lines {AH line} and {EF line}, the (sum of the) angles {AHF angle} and {HFE angle} is thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
Thus, (the sum of) {BHG angle} and {GFE angle} is less than two right-angles.
And (straight-lines) produced to infinity from (internal angles whose sum is) less than two right-angles meet together [Post. 5].
Thus, being produced, {HB line} and {FE line} will meet together.
Let them have been produced, and let them meet together at {K point}.
And let {KL line} have been drawn through point {K point} parallel to either of {EA line} or {FH line} [Prop. 1.31].
And let {HA line} and {GB line} have been produced to points {L point} and {M point} (respectively).
Thus, {HLKF polygon} is a parallelogram, and {HK line} its diagonal.
And {AG polygon} and {ME polygon} (are) parallelograms, and {LB polygon} and {BF polygon} the so-called complements, about {HK line}.
Thus, {LB polygon} is equal to {BF polygon} [Prop. 1.43].
But, {BF polygon} is equal to triangle {C given}.
Thus, {LB polygon} is also equal to {C given}.
Also, since angle {GBE angle} is equal to {ABM angle} [Prop. 1.15], but {GBE angle} is equal to {D given}, {ABM angle} is thus also equal to angle {D given}.

Thus, the parallelogram {LB polygon}, equal to the given triangle {C given}, has been applied to the given straight-line {AB line} in the angle {ABM angle}, which is equal to {D given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
