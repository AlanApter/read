If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has a base greater than the base (of the other), then (the former triangle) will also have the angle encompassed by the equal straight-lines greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the latter).

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be two triangles having the two sides {AB line} and {AC line} equal to the two sides {DE line} and {DF line}, respectively.
(That is), {AB line} to {DE line}, and {AC line} to {DF line}.
And let the base {BC line} be greater than the base {EF line}.
I say that angle {BAC angle} is also greater than {EDF angle}.

For if not, ({BAC angle}) is certainly either equal to, or less than ({EDF angle}).
In fact, {BAC angle} is not equal to {EDF angle}.
For then the base {BC line} would also have been equal to {EF line} [Prop. 1.4].
But it is not.
Thus, angle {BAC angle} is not equal to {EDF angle}.
Neither, indeed, is {BAC angle} less than {EDF angle}.
For then the base {BC line} would also have been less than {EF line} [Prop. 1.24].
But it is not.
Thus, angle {BAC angle} is not less than {EDF angle}.
But it was shown that ({BAC angle} is) also not equal (to {EDF angle}).
Thus, {BAC angle} is greater than {EDF angle}.

Thus, if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has a base greater than the base (of the other), then (the former triangle) will also have the angle encompassed by the equal straight-lines greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the latter).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
