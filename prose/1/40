Equal triangles which are on equal bases, and on the same side, are also between the same parallels.

Let {ABC polygon} and {CDE polygon} be equal triangles on the equal bases {BC line} and {CE line} (respectively), and on the same side.
I say that they are also between the same parallels.

For let {AD line} have been joined. I say that {AD line} is parallel to {BE line}.

For if not, let {AF line} have been drawn through {A point} parallel to {BE line} [Prop. 1.31], and let {FE line} have been joined.
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {FCE polygon}.
For they are on equal bases, {BC line} and {CE line}, and between the same parallels, {BE line} and {AF line} [Prop. 1.38].
But, triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to [triangle] {DCE polygon}.
Thus, [triangle] {DCE polygon} is also equal to triangle {FCE polygon}, the greater to the lesser.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {AF line} is not parallel to {BE line}.
Similarly, we can show that neither (is) any other (straight-line) than {AD line}.
Thus, {AD line} is parallel to {BE line}.

Thus, equal triangles which are on equal bases, and on the same side, are also between the same parallels.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
