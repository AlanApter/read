To construct a parallelogram equal to a given rectilinear figure in a given rectilinear angle.

Let {ABCD polygon} be the given rectilinear figure, and {E given} the given rectilinear angle.
So it is required to construct a parallelogram equal to the rectilinear figure {ABCD polygon} in the given angle {E given}.

Let {DB line} have been joined, and let the parallelogram {FKHG polygon}, equal to the triangle {ABD polygon}, have been constructed in the angle {HKF angle}, which is equal to {E given} [Prop. 1.42].
And let the parallelogram {GHML polygon}, equal to the triangle {DBC polygon}, have been applied to the straight-line {GH line} in the angle {GHM angle}, which is equal to {E given} [Prop. 1.44].
And since angle {E given} is equal to each of (angles) {HKF angle} and {GHM angle}, (angle) {HKF angle} is thus also equal to {GHM angle}.
Let {KHG angle} have been added to both.
Thus, (the sum of) {FKH angle} and {KHG angle} is equal to (the sum of) {KHG angle} and {GHM angle}.
But, (the sum of) {FKH angle} and {KHG angle} is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
Thus, (the sum of) {KHG angle} and {GHM angle} is also equal to two right-angles.
So two straight-lines, {KH line} and {HM line}, not lying on the same side, make the (sum of the) adjacent angles equal to two right-angles at the point {H point} on some straight-line {GH line}.
Thus, {KH line} is straight-on to {HM line} [Prop. 1.14].
And since the straight-line {HG line} falls across the parallel-lines {KM line} and {FG line}, the alternate angles {MHG angle} and {HGF angle} are equal to one another [Prop. 1.29].
Let {HGL angle} have been added to both.
Thus, (the sum of) {MHG angle} and {HGL angle} is equal to (the sum of) {HGF angle} and {HGL angle}.
But,(the sum of) {MHG angle} and {HGL angle} is equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
Thus, (the sum of) {HGF angle} and {HGL angle} is also equal to two right-angles.
Thus, {FG line} is straight-on to {GL line} [Prop. 1.14].
And since {FK line} is equal and parallel to {HG line} [Prop. 1.34], but also {HG line} to {ML line} [Prop. 1.34], {KF line} is thus also equal and parallel to {ML line} [Prop. 1.30].
And the straight-lines {KM line} and {FL line} join them.
Thus, {KM line} and {FL line} are equal and parallel as well [Prop. 1.33].
Thus, {KFLM polygon} is a parallelogram.
And since triangle {ABD polygon} is equal to parallelogram {FKHG polygon}, and {DBC polygon} to {GHML polygon}, the whole rectilinear figure {ABCD polygon} is thus equal to the whole parallelogram {KFLM polygon}.

Thus, the parallelogram {KFLM polygon}, equal to the given rectilinear figure {ABCD polygon}, has been constructed in the angle {FKM angle}, which is equal to the given (angle) {E given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
