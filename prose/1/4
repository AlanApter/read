If two triangles have two corresponding sides equal, and have the angles enclosed by the equal sides equal, then they will also have equal bases, and the two triangles will be equal, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be two triangles having the two sides {AB line} and {AC line} equal to the two sides {DE line} and {DF line}, respectively.
(That is) {AB line} to {DE line}, and {AC line} to {DF line}.
And (let) the angle {BAC angle} (be) equal to the angle {EDF angle}.
I say that the base {BC line} is also equal to the base {EF line}, and triangle {ABC polygon} will be equal to triangle {DEF polygon}, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles.
(That is) {ABC angle} to {DEF angle}, and {ACB angle} to {DFE angle}.

Let the triangle {ABC polygon} be applied to the triangle {DEF polygon}, the point {A point} being placed on the point {D point}, and the straight-line {AB line} on {DE line}.
The point {B point} will also coincide with {E point}, on account of {AB line} being equal to {DE line}.
So (because of) {AB line} coinciding with {DE line}, the straight-line {AC line} will also coincide with {DF line}, on account of the angle {BAC angle} being equal to {EDF angle}.
So the point {C point} will also coincide with the point {F point}, again on account of {AC line} being equal to {DF line}.
But, point {B point} certainly also coincided with point {E point}, so that the base {BC line} will coincide with the base {EF line}.
For if {B point} coincides with {E point}, and {C point} with {F point}, and the base {BC line} does not coincide with {EF line}, then two straight-lines will encompass an area. The very thing is impossible [Post. 1].
Thus, the base {BC line} will coincide with {EF line}, and will be equal to it [C.N. 4].
So the whole triangle {ABC polygon} will coincide with the whole triangle {DEF polygon}, and will be equal to it [C.N. 4].
And the remaining angles will coincide with the remaining angles, and will be equal to them [C.N. 4]. (That is) {ABC angle} to {DEF angle}, and {ACB angle} to {DFE angle} [C.N. 4].

Thus, if two triangles have two corresponding sides equal, and have the angles enclosed by the equal sides equal, then they will also have equal bases, and the two triangles will be equal, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the correspond- ing remaining angles.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
