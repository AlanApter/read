Triangles which are on the same base and between the same parallels are equal to one another.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DBC polygon} be triangles on the same base {BC line}, and between the same parallels {AD line} and {BC line}.
I say that triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {DBC polygon}.

Let {AD line} have been produced in each direction to {E point} and {F point}, and let the (straight-line) {BE line} have been drawn through {B point} parallel to {CA line} [Prop. 1.31], and let the (straight-line) {CF line} have been drawn through {C point} parallel to {BD line} [Prop. 1.31].
Thus, {EBCA polygon} and {DBCF polygon} are both parallelograms, and are equal.
For they are on the same base {BC line}, and between the same parallels {BC line} and {EF line} [Prop. 1.35].
And the triangle {ABC polygon} is half of the parallelogram {EBCA polygon}. For the diagonal {AB line} cuts the latter in half [Prop. 1.34].
And the triangle {DBC polygon} (is) half of the parallelogram {DBCF polygon}.
For the diagonal {DC line} cuts the latter in half [Prop. 1.34].
[And the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {DBC polygon}.

Thus, triangles which are on the same base and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
