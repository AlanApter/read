To construct a square equal to a given rectilinear figure.

Let {A given} be the given rectilinear figure.
So it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilinear figure {A given}.

For let the right-angled parallelogram {BCDE polygon}, equal to the rectilinear figure {A given}, have been constructed [Prop. 1.45].
Therefore, if {BE line} is equal to {ED line} then that (which) was prescribed has taken place.
For the square {BCDE polygon}, equal to the rectilinear figure {A given}, has been constructed.
And if not, then one of the (straight-lines) {BE line} or {ED line} is greater (than the other).
Let {BE line} be greater, and let it have been produced to {F point}, and let {EF line} be made equal to {ED line} [Prop. 1.3].
And let {BF line} have been cut in half at (point) {G point} [Prop. 1.10].
And, with center {G point}, and radius one of the (straight-lines) {GB line} or {GF line}, let the semi-circle {BHF given} have been drawn.
And let {DE line} have been produced to {H point}, and let {GH line} have been joined.

Therefore, since the straight-line {BF line} has been cut--- equally at {G point}, and unequally at {E point}---the rectangle contained by {BE line} and {EF line}, plus the square on {EG line}, is thus equal to the square on {GF line} [Prop. 2.5].
And {GF line} (is) equal to {GH line}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {BE line} and {EF line}, plus the (square) on {GE line}, is equal to the (square) on {GH line}.
And the (sum of the) squares on {HE line} and {EG line} is equal to the (square) on {GH line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {BE line} and {EF line}, plus the (square) on {GE line}, is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {HE line} and {EG line}.
Let the square on {GE line} have been taken from both.
Thus, the remaining rectangle contained by {BE line} and {EF line} is equal to the square on {EH line}.
But, {BCDE polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {BE line} and {EF line}.
For {EF line} (is) equal to {ED line}.
Thus, the parallelogram {BCDE polygon} is equal to the square on {HE line}.
And {BCDE polygon} (is) equal to the rectilinear figure {A given}.
Thus, the rectilinear figure {A given} is also equal to the square (which) can be described on {EH line}.

Thus, a square---(namely), that (which) can be described on {EH line}---has been constructed, equal to the given rectilinear figure {A given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
