If a straight-line is cut at random then the square on the whole (straight-line) is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the pieces (of the straight-line), and twice the rectangle contained by the pieces.

For let the straight-line {AB line} have been cut, at random, at (point) {C point}.
I say that the square on {AB line} is equal to the (sum of the) squares on {AC line} and {CB line}, and twice the rectangle contained by {AC line} and {CB line}.

For let the square {ADEB polygon} have been described on {AB line} [Prop. 1.46], and let {BD line} have been joined, and let {CF line} have been drawn through {C point}, parallel to either of {AD line} or {EB line} [Prop. 1.31], and let {HK line} have been drawn through {G point}, parallel to either of {AB line} or {DE line} [Prop. 1.31].
And since {CF line} is parallel to {AD line}, and {BD line} has fallen across them, the external angle {CGB angle} is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) {ADB angle} [Prop. 1.29].
But, {ADB angle} is equal to {ABD angle}, since the side {BA line} is also equal to {AD line} [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, angle {CGB angle} is also equal to {GBC angle}.
So the side {BC line} is equal to the side {CG line} [Prop. 1.6].
But, {CB line} is equal to {GK line}, and {CG line} to {KB line} [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, {GK line} is also equal to {KB line}.
Thus, {CGKB polygon} is equilateral.
So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
For since {CG line} is parallel to {BK line} [and the straight-line {CB line} has fallen across them], the angles {KBC angle} and {GCB angle} are thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
But {KBC angle} (is) a right-angle.
Thus, {BCG angle} (is) also a rightangle.
So the opposite (angles) {CGK angle} and {GKB angle} are also right-angles [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, {CGKB polygon} is right-angled.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
Thus, it is a square.
And it is on {CB line}.
So, for the same (reasons), {DFGH polygon} is also a square.
And it is on {HG line}, that is to say [on] {AC line} [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, the squares {HDFG polygon} and {KBCG polygon} are on {AC line} and {CB line} (respectively).
And the (rectangle) {AHGC polygon} is equal to the (rectangle) {GFEK polygon} [Prop. 1.43].
And {AHGC polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line}.
For {GC line} (is) equal to {CB line}.
Thus, {GFEK polygon} is also equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line}.
Thus, the (rectangles) {AHGC polygon} and {GFEK polygon} are equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line}.
And {HDFG polygon} and {CGKB polygon} are the squares on {AC line} and {CB line} (respectively).
Thus, the four (figures) {HDFG polygon}, {CGKB polygon}, {AHGC polygon}, and {GFEK polygon} are equal to the (sum of the) squares on {AC line} and {BC line}, and twice the rectangle contained by {AC line} and {CB line}.
But, the (figures) {HDFG polygon}, {CGKB polygon}, {AHGC polygon}, and {GFEK polygon} are (equivalent to) the whole of {ADEB polygon}, which is the square on {AB line}.
Thus, the square on {AB line} is equal to the (sum of the) squares on {AC line} and {CB line}, and twice the rectangle contained by {AC line} and {CB line}.

Thus, if a straight-line is cut at random then the square on the whole (straight-line) is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the pieces (of the straight-line), and twice the rectangle contained by the pieces.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
