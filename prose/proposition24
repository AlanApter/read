If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has the angle encompassed by the equal straight-lines greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the other), then (the former triangle) will also have a base greater than the base (of the latter).

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be two triangles having the two sides {AB line} and {AC line} equal to the two sides {DE line} and {DF line}, respectively.
(That is), {AB line} to {DE line}, and {AC line} to {DF line}.
Let them also have the angle {BAC angle} greater than the angle {FDE angle}.
I say that the base {BC line} is greater than the base {EF line}.

For since angle {BAC angle} is greater than angle {EDF angle}, let (angle) {EDG angle}, equal to angle {BAC angle}, have been constructed at point {D point} on the straight-line {DE line} [Prop. 1.23].
And let {DG line} be made equal to either of {AC line} or {DF line} [Prop. 1.3], and let {EG line} and {FG line} have been joined.

Therefore, since {AB line} is equal to {DE line} and {AC line} to {DG line}, the two (straight-lines) {BA line}, {AC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {ED line}, {DG line}, respectively.
Also the angle {BAC angle} is equal to the angle {EDG angle}.
Thus, the base {BC line} is equal to the base {EG line} [Prop. 1.4].
Again, since {DF line} is equal to {DG line}, angle {DGF angle} is also equal to angle {DFG angle} [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, {DFG angle} (is) greater than {EGF angle}.
Thus, {EFG angle} is much greater than {EGF angle}.
And since triangle {EFG polygon} has angle {EFG angle} greater than {EGF angle}, and the greater angle subtends the greater side [Prop. 1.19], side {EG line} (is) thus also greater than {EF line}.
But {EG line} (is) equal to {BC line}.
Thus, {BC line} (is) also greater than {EF line}.

Thus, if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has the angle encompassed by the equal straight-lines greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the other), then (the former triangle) will also have a base greater than the base (of the latter).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
