In equal circles, angles have the same ratio as the (ratio of the) circumferences on which they stand, whether they are standing at the centers (of the circles) or at the circumferences.

Let {ABC circle G} and {DEF circle H} be equal circles, and let {BGC angle} and {EHF angle} be angles at their centers, {G point} and {H point} (respectively), and {BAC angle} and {EDF angle} (angles) at their circumferences.
I say that as circumference {BC arcc G} is to circumference {EF arcc H}, so angle {BGC angle} (is) to {EHF angle}, and (angle) {BAC angle} to {EDF angle}.

For let any number whatsoever of consecutive (circumferences), {CK arcc G} and {KL arcc G}, be made equal to circumference {BC arcc G}, and any number whatsoever, {FM arcc H} and {MN arcc H}, to circumference {EF arcc H}.
And let {GK line}, {GL line}, {HM line}, and {HN line} have been joined.

Therefore, since circumferences {BC arcc G}, {CK arcc G}, and {KL arcc G} are equal to one another, angles {BGC angle}, {CGK angle}, and {KGL angle} are also equal to one another [Prop. 3.27].
Thus, as many times as circumference {BL arcc G} is (divisible) by {BC arcc G}, so many times is angle {BGL angle} also (divisible) by {BGC angle}.
And so, for the same (reasons), as many times as circumference {EN arcc H} is (divisible) by {EF arcc H}, so many times is angle {NHE angle} also (divisible) by {EHF angle}.
Thus, if circumference {BL arcc G} is equal to circumference {EN arcc H} then angle {BGL angle} is also equal to {EHN angle} [Prop. 3.27], and if circumference {BL arcc G} is greater than circumference {EN arcc H} then angle {BGL angle} is also greater than {EHN angle}, and if ({BL arcc G} is) less (than {EN arcc H} then {BGL angle} is also) less (than {EHN angle}).
So there are four magnitudes, two circumferences {BC arcc G} and {EF arcc H}, and two angles {BGC angle} and {EHF angle}.
And equal multiples have been taken of circumference {BC arcc G} and angle {BGC angle}, (namely) circumference {BL arcc G} and angle {BGL angle}, and of circumference {EF arcc H} and angle {EHF angle}, (namely) circumference {EN arcc H} and angle {EHN angle}.
And it has been shown that if circumference {BL arcc G} exceeds circumference {EN arcc H} then angle {BGL angle} also exceeds angle {EHN angle}, and if ({BL arcc G} is) equal (to {EN arcc H} then {BGL angle} is also) equal (to {EHN angle}), and if ({BL arcc G} is) less (than {EN arcc H} then {BGL angle} is also) less (than {EHN angle}).
Thus, as circumference {BC arcc G} (is) to {EF arcc H}, so angle {BGC angle} (is) to {EHF angle} [Def. 5.5].
But as angle {BGC angle} (is) to {EHF angle}, so (angle) {BAC angle} (is) to {EDF angle} [Prop. 5.15].
For the former (are) double the latter (respectively) [Prop. 3.20].
Thus, also, as circumference {BC arcc G} (is) to circumference {EF arcc H}, so angle {BGC angle} (is) to {EHF angle}, and {BAC angle} to {EDF angle}.

Thus, in equal circles, angles have the same ratio as the (ratio of the) circumferences on which they stand, whether they are standing at the centers (of the circles) or at the circumferences.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
