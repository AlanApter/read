Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) their sides.

Let {AC polygon} and {CF polygon} be equiangular parallelograms having angle {BCD angle} equal to {ECG angle}.
I say that parallelogram {AC polygon} has to parallelogram {CF polygon} the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) their sides.

For let {BC line} be laid down so as to be straight-on to {CG line}.
Thus, {DC line} is also straight-on to {CE line} [Prop. 1.14].
And let the parallelogram {DG polygon} have been completed.
And let some straight-line {K magnitude} have been laid down.
And let it be contrived that as {BC line} (is) to {CG line}, so {K magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, and as {DC line} (is) to {CE line}, so {L magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude} [Prop. 6.12].

Thus, the ratios of {K magnitude} to {L magnitude} and of {L magnitude} to {M magnitude} are the same as the ratios of the sides, (namely), {BC line} to {CG line} and {DC line} to {CE line} (respectively).
But, the ratio of {K magnitude} to {M magnitude} is compounded out of the ratio of {K magnitude} to {L magnitude} and (the ratio) of {L magnitude} to {M magnitude}.
Hence, {K magnitude} also has to {M magnitude} the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of the parallelograms).
And since as {BC line} is to {CG line}, so parallelogram {AC polygon} (is) to {CH polygon} [Prop. 6.1], but as {BC line} (is) to {CG line}, so {K magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, thus, also, as {K magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, so (parallelogram) {AC polygon} (is) to {CH polygon}.
Again, since as {DC line} (is) to {CE line}, so parallelogram {CH polygon} (is) to {CF polygon} [Prop. 6.1], but as {DC line} (is) to {CE line}, so {L magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude}, thus, also, as {L magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude}, so parallelogram {CH polygon} (is) to parallelogram {CF polygon}.
Therefore, since it was shown that as {K magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, so parallelogram {AC polygon} (is) to parallelogram {CH polygon}, and as {L magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude}, so parallelogram {CH polygon} (is) to parallelogram {CF polygon}, thus, via equality, as {K magnitude} is to {M magnitude}, so (parallelogram) {AC polygon} (is) to parallelogram {CF polygon} [Prop. 5.22].
And {K magnitude} has to {M magnitude} the ratio compounded out of (the ratios of) the sides (of the parallelograms).
Thus, (parallelogram) {AC polygon} also has to (parallelogram) {CF polygon} the ratio compounded out of (the ratio of) their sides.

Thus, equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded out of (the ratio of) their sides.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
