To cut a given finite straight-line in extreme and mean ratio.

Let {AB line} be the given finite straight-line.
So it is required to cut the straight-line {AB line} in extreme and mean ratio.

Let the square {BC polygonl} have been described on {AB line} [Prop.  1.46], and let the parallelogram {CD polygonl}, equal to {BC polygonl}, have been applied to {AC line}, overshooting by the figure {AD polygonl} (which is) similar to {BC polygonl} [Prop. 6.29].

And {BC polygonl} is a square.
Thus, {AD polygonl} is also a square.
And since {BC polygonl} is equal to {CD polygonl}, let (rectangle) {CE polygonl} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remaining (rectangle) {BF polygonl} is equal to the remaining (square) {AD polygonl}.
And it is also equiangular to it.
Thus, the sides of {BF polygonl} and {AD polygonl} about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional [Prop. 6.14].
Thus, as {FE line} is to {ED line}, so {AE line} (is) to {EB line}.
And {FE line} (is) equal to {AB line}, and {ED line} to {AE line}.
Thus, as {BA line} is to {AE line}, so {AE line} (is) to {EB line}.
And {AB line} (is) greater than {AE line}.
Thus, {AE line} (is) also greater than {EB line} [Prop. 5.14].

Thus, the straight-line {AB line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {E point}, and {AE line} is its greater piece.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
