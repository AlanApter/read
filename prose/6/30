To cut a given finite straight-line in extreme and mean ratio.

Let {AB line} be the given finite straight-line.
So it is required to cut the straight-line {AB line} in extreme and mean ratio.

Let the square {ABHC polygon} have been described on {AB line} [Prop.  1.46], and let the parallelogram {CGDF polygon}, equal to {ABHC polygon}, have been applied to {AC line}, overshooting by the figure {AGDE polygon} (which is) similar to {ABHC polygon} [Prop. 6.29].

And {ABHC polygon} is a square.
Thus, {AGDE polygon} is also a square.
And since {ABHC polygon} is equal to {CGDF polygon}, let (rectangle) {CAEF polygon} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remaining (rectangle) {BEFH polygon} is equal to the remaining (square) {AGDE polygon}.
And it is also equiangular to it.
Thus, the sides of {BEFH polygon} and {AGDE polygon} about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional [Prop. 6.14].
Thus, as {FE line} is to {ED line}, so {AE line} (is) to {EB line}.
And {FE line} (is) equal to {AB line}, and {ED line} to {AE line}.
Thus, as {BA line} is to {AE line}, so {AE line} (is) to {EB line}.
And {AB line} (is) greater than {AE line}.
Thus, {AE line} (is) also greater than {EB line} [Prop. 5.14].

Thus, the straight-line {AB line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {E point}, and {AE line} is its greater piece.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
