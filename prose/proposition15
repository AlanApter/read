If two straight-lines cut one another then they make the vertically opposite angles equal to one another.

For let the two straight-lines {AB line} and {CD line} cut one another at the point {E point}.
I say that angle {AEC angle} is equal to (angle) {DEB angle}, and (angle) {CEB angle} to (angle) {AED angle}.

For since the straight-line {AE line} stands on the straight-line {CD line}, making the angles {CEA angle} and {AED angle}, the (sum of the) angles {CEA angle} and {AED angle} is thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
Again, since the straight-line {DE line} stands on the straight-line {AB line}, making the angles {AED angle} and {DEB angle}, the (sum of the) angles {AED angle} and {DEB angle} is thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13].
But (the sum of) {CEA angle} and {AED angle} was also shown (to be) equal to two right-angles.
Thus, (the sum of) {CEA angle} and {AED angle} is equal to (the sum of) {AED angle} and {DEB angle} [C.N. 1]. Let {AED angle} have been subtracted from both.
Thus, the remainder {CEA angle} is equal to the remainder {BED angle} [C.N. 3].
Similarly, it can be shown that {CEB angle} and {DEA angle} are also equal.

Thus, if two straight-lines cut one another then they make the vertically opposite angles equal to one another. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
