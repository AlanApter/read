To circumscribe a square about a given circle.

Let {ABCD circle E} be the given circle.
So it is required to circumscribe a square about circle {ABCD circle E}.

Let two diameters of circle {ABCD circle E}, {AC line} and {BD line}, have been drawn at right-angles to one another.
And let {FG line}, {GH line}, {HK line}, and {KF line} have been drawn through points {A point}, {B point}, {C point}, and {D point} (respectively), touching circle {ABCD circle E}.

Therefore, since {FG line} touches circle {ABCD circle E}, and {EA line} has been joined from the center {E point} to the point of contact {A point}, the angles at {A point} are thus right-angles [Prop. 3.18].
So, for the same (reasons), the angles at points {B point}, {C point}, and {D point} are also right-angles.
And since angle {AEB angle} is a right-angle, and {EBG angle} is also a right-angle, {GH line} is thus parallel to {AC line} [Prop. 1.29].
So, for the same (reasons), {AC line} is also parallel to {FK line}.
So that {GH line} is also parallel to {FK line} [Prop. 1.30].
So, similarly, we can show that {GF line} and {HK line} are each parallel to {BED line}.
Thus, {GK polygon}, {GC polygon}, {AK polygon}, {FB polygon}, and {BK polygon} are (all) parallelograms.
Thus, {GF line} is equal to {HK line}, and {GH line} to {FK line} [Prop. 1.34].
And since {AC line} is equal to {BD line}, but {AC line} (is) also (equal) to each of {GH line} and {FK line}, and {BD line} is equal to each of {GF line} and {HK line} [Prop. 1.34], the quadrilateral {FGHK polygon} is thus equilateral.
So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
For since {GBEA polygon} is a parallelogram, and {AEB angle} is a right-angle, {AGB angle} is thus also a right-angle [Prop. 1.34].
So, similarly, we can show that the angles at {H point}, {K point}, and {F point} are also right-angles.
Thus, {FGHK polygon} is right-angled.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
Thus, it is a square [Def. 1.22].
And it has been circumscribed about circle {ABCD circle E}.

Thus, a square has been circumscribed about the given circle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
