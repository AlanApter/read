Straight-lines joining equal and parallel (straight-lines) on the same sides are themselves also equal and parallel.

Let {AB line} and {CD line} be equal and parallel (straight-lines), and let the straight-lines {AC line} and {BD line} join them on the same sides.
I say that {AC line} and {BD line} are also equal and parallel.

Let {BC line} have been joined.
And since {AB line} is parallel to {CD line}, and {BC line} has fallen across them, the alternate angles {ABC angle} and {BCD angle} are equal to one another [Prop. 1.29].
And since {AB line} and {CD line} are equal, and {BC line} is common, the two (straight-lines) {AB line}, {BC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DC line}, {CB line}.
And the angle {ABC angle} is equal to the angle {BCD angle}.
Thus, the base {AC line} is equal to the base {BD line}, and triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {ACD polygon}, and the remaining angles will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles subtended by the equal sides [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, angle {ACB angle} is equal to {CBD angle}.
Also, since the straight-line {BC line}, (in) falling across the two straight-lines {AC line} and {BD line}, has made the alternate angles ({ACB angle} and {CBD angle}) equal to one another, {AC line} is thus parallel to {BD line} [Prop. 1.27].
And ({AC line}) was also shown (to be) equal to ({BD line}).

Thus, straight-lines joining equal and parallel (straight-lines) on the same sides are themselves also equal and parallel.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
