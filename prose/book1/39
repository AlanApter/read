Equal triangles which are on the same base, and on the same side, are also between the same parallels.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DBC polygon} be equal triangles which are on the same base {BC line}, and on the same side.
I say that they are also between the same parallels.

For let {AD line} have been joined.
I say that {AD line} and {BC line} are parallel.

For, if not, let {AE line} have been drawn through point {A point} parallel to the straight-line {BC line} [Prop. 1.31], and let {EC line} have been joined.
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {EBC polygon}.
For it is on the same base as it, {BC line}, and between the same parallels [Prop. 1.37].
But {ABC polygon} is equal to {DBC polygon}.
Thus, {DBC polygon} is also equal to {EBC polygon}, the greater to the lesser.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, {AE line} is not parallel to {BC line}.
Similarly, we can show that neither (is) any other (straight-line) than {AD line}.
Thus, {AD line} is parallel to {BC line}.

Thus, equal triangles which are on the same base, and on the same side, are also between the same parallels.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
