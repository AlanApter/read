Parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.

Let {ABCD polygon} and {EFGH polygon} be parallelograms which are on the equal bases {BC line} and {FG line}, and (are) between the same parallels {AH line} and {BG line}.
I say that the parallelogram {ABCD polygon} is equal to {EFGH polygon}.

For let {BE line} and {CH line} have been joined.
And since {BC line} and {FG line} are equal, but {FG line} and {EH line} are equal [Prop. 1.34], {BC line} and {EH line} are thus also equal.
And they are also parallel, and {EB line} and {HC line} join them.
But (straight-lines) joining equal and parallel (straight-lines) on the same sides are (themselves) equal and parallel [Prop. 1.33] [thus, {EB line} and {HC line} are also equal and parallel].
Thus, {EBCH polygon} is a parallelogram [Prop. 1.34], and is equal to {ABCD polygon}.
For it has the same base, {BC line}, as ({ABCD polygon}), and is between the same parallels, {BC line} and {AH line}, as ({ABCD polygon}) [Prop. 1.35].
So, for the same (reasons), {EFGH polygon} is also equal to the same (parallelogram) {EBCH polygon} [Prop. 1.34].
So that the parallelogram {ABCD polygon} is also equal to {EFGH polygon}.

Thus, parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
