If the square on one of the sides of a triangle is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the remaining sides of the triangle then the angle contained by the remaining sides of the triangle is a right-angle.

For let the square on one of the sides, {BC line}, of triangle {ABC polygon} be equal to the (sum of the) squares on the sides {BA line} and {AC line}.
I say that angle {BAC angle} is a right-angle.

For let {AD line} have been drawn from point {A point} at right-angles to the straight-line {AC line} [Prop. 1.11], and let {AD line} have been made equal to {BA line} [Prop. 1.3], and let {DC line} have been joined.
Since {DA line} is equal to {AB line}, the square on {DA line} is thus also equal to the square on {AB line}.
Let the square on {AC line} have been added to both.
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on {DA line} and {AC line} is equal to the (sum of the) squares on {BA line} and {AC line}.
But, the (sum of the squares) on {DA line} and {AC line} is equal to the (square) on {DC line}.
For angle {DAC angle} is a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
But, the (sum of the squares) on {BA line} and {AC line} is equal to the (square) on {BC line}.
For (that) was assumed.
Thus, the square on {DC line} is equal to the square on {BC line}.
So {DC line} is also equal to {BC line}.
And since {DA line} is equal to {AB line}, and {AC line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {DA line}, {AC line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BA line}, {AC line}.
And the base {DC line} is equal to the base {BC line}.
Thus, angle {DAC angle} [is] equal to angle {BAC angle} [Prop. 1.8].
But {DAC angle} is a right-angle.
Thus, {BAC angle} is also a right-angle.

Thus, if the square on one of the sides of a triangle is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the remaining sides of the triangle then the angle contained by the remaining sides of the triangle is a right-angle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
