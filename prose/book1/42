To construct a parallelogram equal to a given triangle in a given rectilinear angle.

Let {ABC polygon} be the given triangle, and {D given} the given rectilinear angle.
So it is required to construct a parallelogram equal to triangle {ABC polygon} in the rectilinear angle {D given}.

Let {BC line} have been cut in half at {E point} [Prop. 1.10], and let {AE line} have been joined.
And let (angle) {CEF angle}, equal to angle {D given}, have been constructed at the point {E point} on the straight-line {EC line} [Prop. 1.23].
And let {AG line} have been drawn through {A point} parallel to {EC line} [Prop. 1.31], and let {CG line} have been drawn through {C point} parallel to {EF line} [Prop. 1.31].
Thus, {FECG polygon} is a parallelogram.
And since {BE line} is equal to {EC line}, triangle {ABE polygon} is also equal to triangle {AEC polygon}.
For they are on the equal bases, {BE line} and {EC line}, and between the same parallels, {BC line} and {AG line} [Prop. 1.38].
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is double (the area) of triangle {AEC polygon}.
And parallelogram {FECG polygon} is also double (the area) of triangle {AEC polygon}.
For it has the same base as ({AEC polygon}), and is between the same parallels as ({AEC polygon}) [Prop. 1.41].
Thus, parallelogram {FECG polygon} is equal to triangle {ABC polygon}.
({FECG polygon}) also has the angle {CEF angle} equal to the given (angle) {D given}.

Thus, parallelogram {FECG polygon}, equal to the given triangle {ABC polygon}, has been constructed in the angle {CEF angle}, which is equal to {D given}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
