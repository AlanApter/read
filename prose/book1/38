Triangles which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.

Let {ABC polygon} and {DEF polygon} be triangles on the equal bases {BC line} and {EF line}, and between the same parallels {BF line} and {AD line}.
I say that triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {DEF polygon}.

For let {AD line} have been produced in each direction to {G point} and {H point},
and let the (straight-line) {BG line} have been drawn through {B point} parallel to {CA line} [Prop. 1.31], and let the (straight-line) {FH line} have been drawn through {F point} parallel to {DE line} [Prop. 1.31].
Thus, {GBCA polygon} and {DEFH polygon} are each parallelograms.
And {GBCA polygon} is equal to {DEFH polygon}.
For they are on the equal bases {BC line} and {EF line}, and between the same parallels {BF line} and {GH line} [Prop. 1.36].
And triangle {ABC polygon} is half of the parallelogram {GBCA polygon}.
For the diagonal {AB line} cuts the latter in half [Prop. 1.34].
And triangle {FED polygon} (is) half of parallelogram {DEFH polygon}.
For the diagonal {DF line} cuts the latter in half.
[And the halves of equal things are equal to one another].
Thus, triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {DEF polygon}.

Thus, triangles which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
