For any parallelogram, the complements of the parallelograms about the diagonal are equal to one another.

Let {ABCD polygon} be a parallelogram, and {AC line} its diagonal.
And let {EAHK polygon} and {FCGK polygon} be the parallelograms about {AC line},and {BGKE polygon} and {KFDH polygon} the so-called complements (about {AC line}).
I say that the complement {BGKE polygon} is equal to the complement {KFDH polygon}.

For since {ABCD polygon} is a parallelogram, and {AC line} its diagonal, triangle {ABC polygon} is equal to triangle {ACD polygon} [Prop. 1.34].
Again, since {EAHK polygon} is a parallelogram, and {AK line} is its diagonal, triangle {AEK polygon} is equal to triangle {AHK polygon} [Prop. 1.34].
So, for the same (reasons), triangle {KFC polygon} is also equal to (triangle) {KGC polygon}.
Therefore, since triangle {AEK polygon} is equal to triangle {AHK polygon}, and {KFC polygon} to {KGC polygon}, triangle {AEK polygon} plus {KGC polygon} is equal to triangle {AHK polygon} plus {KFC polygon}.
And the whole triangle {ABC polygon} is also equal to the whole (triangle) {ADC polygon}.
Thus, the remaining complement {BGKE polygon} is equal to the remaining complement {KFDH polygon}.

Thus, for any parallelogramic figure, the complements of the parallelograms about the diagonal are equal to one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
