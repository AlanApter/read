(Straight-lines) parallel to the same straight-line are also parallel to one another.

Let each of the (straight-lines) {AB line} and {CD line} be parallel to {EF line}. I say that {AB line} is also parallel to {CD line}.

For let the straight-line {GK line} fall across ({AB line}, {CD line}, and {EF line}).

And since {GK line} has fallen across the parallel straight-lines {AB line} and {EF line}, (angle) {AGK angle} (is) thus equal to {GHF angle} [Prop. 1.29].
Again, since {GK line} has fallen across the parallel straight-lines {EF line} and {CD line}, (angle) {GHF angle} is equal to {GKD angle} [Prop. 1.29].
But {AGK angle} was also shown (to be) equal to {GHF angle}.
Thus, {AGK angle} is also equal to {GKD angle}.
And they are alternate (angles).
Thus, {AB line} is parallel to {CD line} [Prop. 1.27].

[Thus, (straight-lines) parallel to the same straight-line are also parallel to one another.]
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
