To insert a straight-line equal to a given straight-line into a circle, (the latter straight-line) not being greater than the diameter of the circle.

Let ABC be the given circle, and D the given straight-line (which is) not greater than the diameter of the circle.
So it is required to insert a straight-line, equal to the straight-line D, into the circle ABC.

Let a diameter BC of circle ABC have been drawn.
Therefore, if BC is equal to D then that (which) was prescribed has taken place.
For the (straight-line) BC, equal to the straight-line D, has been inserted into the circle ABC.
And if BC is greater than D then let CE be made equal to D [Prop. 1.3], and let the circle EAF have been drawn with center C and radius CE.
And let CA have been joined.

Therefore, since the point C is the center of circle EAF, CA is equal to CE.
But, CE is equal to D.
Thus, D is also equal to CA.

Thus, CA, equal to the given straight-line D, has been inserted into the given circle ABC.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
