To inscribe a circle in a given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular.

Let {ABCDE polygon} be the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon.
So it is required to inscribe a circle in pentagon {ABCDE polygon}.

For let angles {BCD angle} and {CDE angle} have each been cut in half by each of the straight-lines {CF line} and {DF line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.9].
And from the point {F point}, at which the straight-lines {CF line} and {DF line} meet one another, let the straight-lines {FB line}, {FA line}, and {FE line} have been joined.
And since {BC line} is equal to {CD line}, and {CF line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {BC line}, {CF line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {DC line}, {CF line}.
And angle {BCF angle} [is] equal to angle {DCF angle}.
Thus, the base {BF line} is equal to the base {DF line}, and triangle {BCF polygon} is equal to triangle {DCF polygon}, and the remaining angles will be equal to the (corresponding) remaining angles which the equal sides subtend [Prop. 1.4].
Thus, angle {CBF angle} (is) equal to {CDF angle}.
And since {CDE angle} is double {CDF angle}, and {CDE angle} (is) equal to {ABC angle}, and {CDF angle} to {CBF angle}, {CBA angle} is thus also double {CBF angle}.
Thus, angle {ABF angle} is equal to {FBC angle}.
Thus, angle {ABC angle} has been cut in half by the straight-line {BF line}.
So, similarly, it can be shown that {BAE angle} and {AED angle} have been cut in half by the straight-lines {FA line} and {FE line}, respectively.
So let {FG line}, {FH line}, {FK line}, {FL line}, and {FM line} have been drawn from point {F point}, perpendicular to the straight-lines {AB line}, {BC line}, {CD line}, {DE line}, and {EA line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.12].
And since angle {HCF angle} is equal to {KCF angle}, and the right-angle {FHC angle} is also equal to the [right-angle] {FKC angle}, {FHC polygon} and {FKC polygon} are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal to one side, (namely) their common (side) {FC line}, subtending one of the equal angles.
Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides [Prop. 1.26].
Thus, the perpendicular {FH line} (is) equal to the perpendicular {FK line}.
So, similarly, it can be shown that {FL line}, {FM line}, and {FG line} are each equal to each of {FH line} and {FK line}.
Thus, the five straight-lines {FG line}, {FH line}, {FK line}, {FL line}, and {FM line} are equal to one another.
Thus, the circle drawn with center {F point}, and radius one of {G point}, {H point}, {K point}, {L point}, or {M point}, will also go through the remaining points, and will touch the straight-lines {AB line}, {BC line}, {CD line}, {DE line}, and {EA line}, on account of the angles at points {G point}, {H point}, {K point}, {L point}, and {M point} being right-angles.
For if it does not touch them, but cuts them, it follows that a (straight-line) drawn at right-angles to the diameter of the circle, from its extremity, falls inside the circle.
The very thing was shown (to be) absurd [Prop. 3.16].
Thus, the circle drawn with center {F point}, and radius one of {G point}, {H point}, {K point}, {L point}, or {M point}, does not cut the straight-lines {AB line}, {BC line}, {CD line}, {DE line}, or {EA line}.
Thus, it will touch them.
Let it have been drawn, like {GHKLM circle F} (in the figure).

Thus, a circle has been inscribed in the given pentagon which is equilateral and equiangular.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
