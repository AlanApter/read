To inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in a given circle.

Let {ABCDEF circle G} be the given circle.
So it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in circle {ABCDEF circle G}.

Let the diameter {AD line} of circle {ABCDEF circle G} have been drawn, and let the center {G point} of the circle have been found [Prop. 3.1].
And let the circle {EGCH circle D} have been drawn, with center {D point}, and radius {DG line}.
And {EG line} and {CG line} being joined, let them have been drawn across (the circle) to points {B point} and {F point} (respectively).
And let {AB line}, {BC line}, {CD line}, {DE line}, {EF line}, and {FA line} have been joined.
I say that the hexagon {ABCDEF polygon} is equilateral and equiangular.

For since point {G point} is the center of circle {ABCDEF circle G}, {GE line} is equal to {GD line}.
Again, since point {D point} is the center of circle {GCH circle D}, {DE line} is equal to {DG line}.
But, {GE line} was shown (to be) equal to {GD line}.
Thus, {GE line} is also equal to {ED line}.
Thus, triangle {EGD polygon} is equilateral.
Thus, its three angles {EGD angle}, {GDE angle}, and {DEG angle} are also equal to one another, inasmuch as the angles at the base of isosceles triangles are equal to one another [Prop. 1.5].
And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, angle {EGD angle} is one third of two right-angles.
So, similarly, {DGC angle} can also be shown (to be) one third of two right-angles.
And since the straight-line {CG line}, standing on {EB line}, makes adjacent angles {EGC angle} and {CGB angle} equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13], the remaining angle {CGB angle} is thus also one third of two right-angles.
Thus, angles {EGD angle}, {DGC angle}, and {CGB angle} are equal to one another.
And hence the (angles) opposite to them {BGA angle}, {AGF angle}, and {FGE angle} are also equal[Prop. 1.15].
Thus, the six angles {EGD angle}, {DGC angle}, {CGB angle}, {BGA angle}, {AGF angle}, and {FGE angle} are equal to one another.
And equal angles stand on equal circumferences [Prop. 3.26].
Thus, the six circumferences {AB arc G}, {BC arc G}, {CD arc G}, {DE arc G}, {EF arc G}, and {FA arc G} are equal to one another.
And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight-lines [Prop. 3.29].
Thus, the six straight-lines ({AB line}, {BC line}, {CD line}, {DE line}, {EF line}, and {FA line}) are equal to one another.
Thus, hexagon {ABCDEF polygon} is equilateral.
So, I say that (it is) also equiangular.
For since circumference {FA arc G} is equal to circumference {ED arcc G}, let circumference {ABCD arc G} have been added to both.
Thus, the whole of {FABCD arc G} is equal to the whole of {EDCBA arcc G}.
And angle {FED angle} stands on circumference {FABCD arc G}, and angle {AFE angle} on circumference {EDCBA arcc G}.
Thus, angle {AFE angle} is equal to {DEF angle} [Prop. 3.27].
Similarly, it can also be shown that the remaining angles of hexagon {ABCDEF polygon} are individually equal to each of the angles {AFE angle} and {FED angle}.
Thus, hexagon {ABCDEF polygon} is equiangular.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
And it has been inscribed in circle {ABCDE circle G}.

Thus, an equilateral and equiangular hexagon has been inscribed in the given circle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

Corollary

So, from this, (it is) manifest that a side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle.
And similarly to a pentagon, if we draw tangents to the circle through the (sixfold) divisions of the (circumference of the) circle, an equilateral and equiangular hexagon can be circumscribed about the circle, analogously to the aforementioned pentagon.
And, further, by (means) similar to the aforementioned pentagon, we can inscribe and circumscribe a circle in (and about) a given hexagon.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
