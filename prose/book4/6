To inscribe a square in a given circle.

Let {ABCD circle E} be the given circle.
So it is required to inscribe a square in circle {ABCD circle E}.

Let two diameters of circle {ABCD circle E}, {AC line} and {BD line}, have been drawn at right-angles to one another.
And let {AB line}, {BC line}, {CD line}, and {DA line} have been joined.

And since {BE line} is equal to {ED line}, for {E point} (is) the center (of the circle), and {EA line} is common and at right-angles, the base {AB line} is thus equal to the base {AD line} [Prop. 1.4].
So, for the same (reasons), each of {BC line} and {CD line} is equal to each of {AB line} and {AD line}.
Thus, the quadrilateral {ABCD polygon} is equilateral.
So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
For since the straight-line {BD line} is a diameter of circle {ABCD circle E}, {BAD arc E} is thus a semi-circle.
Thus, angle {BAD angle} (is) a right-angle [Prop. 3.31].
So, for the same (reasons), (angles) {ABC angle}, {BCD angle}, and {CDA angle} are also each right-angles.
Thus, the quadrilateral {ABCD polygon} is right-angled.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
Thus, it is a square [Def. 1.22].
And it has been inscribed in circle {ABCD circle E}.

Thus, the square {ABCD polygon} has been inscribed in the given circle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
