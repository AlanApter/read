To circumscribe a circle about a given pentagon which is equilateral and equiangular.

Let ABCDE be the given pentagon which is equilateral and equiangular.
So it is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon ABCDE.

So let angles BCD and CDE have been cut in half by the (straight-lines) CF and DF, respectively [Prop. 1.9].
And let the straight-lines FB, FA, and FE have been joined from point F, at which the straight-lines meet, to the points B, A, and E (respectively).
So, similarly, to the (proposition) before this (one), it can be shown that angles CBA, BAE, and AED have also been cut in half by the straight-lines FB, FA, and FE, respectively.
And since angle BCD is equal to CDE, and FCD is half of BCD, and CDF half of CDE, FCD is thus also equal to FDC.
So that side FC is also equal to side FD [Prop. 1.6].
So, similarly, it can be shown that F B, FA, and FE are also each equal to each of FC and FD.
Thus, the five straight-lines FA, FB, FC, FD, and FE are equal to one another.
Thus, the circle drawn with center F, and radius one of FA, FB, FC, FD, or FE, will also go through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed.
Let it have been (so) circumscribed, and let it be ABCDE.

Thus, a circle has been circumscribed about the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
