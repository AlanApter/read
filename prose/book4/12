To circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about a given circle.

Let {ABCDE circle F} be the given circle.
So it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about circle {ABCDE circle F}.

Let {A point}, {B point}, {C point}, {D point}, and {E point} have been conceived as the angular points of a pentagon having been inscribed (in circle {ABCDE circle F}) [Prop. 3.11], such that the circumferences {AB arcc F}, {BC arcc F}, {CD arcc F}, {DE arcc F}, and {EA arcc F} are equal.
And let {GH line}, {HK line}, {KL line}, {LM line}, and {MG line} have been drawn through (points) {A point}, {B point}, {C point}, {D point}, and {E point} (respectively), touching the circle.
And let the center {F point} of the circle {ABCDE circle F} have been found [Prop. 3.1].
And let {FB line}, {FK line}, {FC line}, {FL line}, and {FD line} have been joined.

And since the straight-line {KL line} touches (circle) {ABCDE circle F} at {C point}, and {FC line} has been joined from the center {F point} to the point of contact {C point}, {FC line} is thus perpendicular to {KL line} [Prop. 3.18].
Thus, each of the angles at {C point} is a right-angle.
So, for the same (reasons), the angles at {B point} and {D point} are also right-angles.
And since angle {FCK angle} is a right-angle, the (square) on {FK line} is thus equal to the (sum of the squares) on {FC line} and {CK line} [Prop. 1.47].
So, for the same (reasons), the (square) on {FK line} is also equal to the (sum of the squares) on {FB line} and {BK line}.
So that the (sum of the squares) on {FC line} and {CK line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {FB line} and {BK line}, of which the (square) on {FC line} is equal to the (square) on {FB line}.
Thus, the remaining (square) on {CK line} is equal to the remaining (square) on {BK line}.
Thus, {BK line} (is) equal to {CK line}.
And since {FB line} is equal to {FC line}, and {FK line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {BF line}, {FK line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {CF line}, {FK line}.
And the base {BK line} [is] equal to the base {CK line}.
Thus, angle {BFK angle} is equal to [angle] {KFC angle} [Prop. 1.8].
And {BKF angle} (is equal) to {FKC angle} [Prop. 1.8].
Thus, {BFC angle} (is) double {KFC angle}, and {BKC angle} (is double) {FKC angle}.
So, for the same (reasons), {CFD angle} is also double {CFL angle}, and {DLC angle} (is also double) {FLC angle}.
And since circumference {BC arcc F} is equal to {CD arcc F}, angle {BFC angle} is also equal to {CFD angle} [Prop. 3.27].
And {BFC angle} is double {KFC angle}, and {DFC angle} (is double) {LFC angle}.
Thus, {KFC angle} is also equal to {LFC angle}.
And angle {FCK angle} is also equal to {FCL angle}.
So, {FKC polygon} and {FLC polygon} are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal to one side, (namely) their common (side) {FC line}.
Thus, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle [Prop. 1.26].
Thus, the straight-line {KC line} (is) equal to {CL line}, and the angle {FKC angle} to {FLC angle}.
And since {KC line} is equal to {CL line}, {KL line} (is) thus double {KC line}.
So, for the same (reasons), it can be shown that {HK line} (is) also double {BK line}.
And {BK line} is equal to {KC line}.
Thus, {HK line} is also equal to {KL line}.
So, similarly, each of {HG line}, {GM line}, and {ML line} can also be shown (to be) equal to each of {HK line} and {KL line}.
Thus, pentagon {GHKLM polygon} is equilateral.
So I say that (it is) also equiangular.
For since angle {FKC angle} is equal to {FLC angle}, and {HKL angle} was shown (to be) double {FKC angle}, and {KLM angle} double {FLC angle}, {HKL angle} is thus also equal to {KLM angle}.
So, similarly, each of {KHG angle}, {HGM angle}, and {GML angle} can also be shown (to be) equal to each of {HKL angle} and {KLM angle}.
Thus, the five angles {GHK angle}, {HKL angle}, {KLM angle}, {LMG angle}, and {MGH angle} are equal to one another.
Thus, the pentagon {GHKLM polygon} is equiangular.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral, and has been circumscribed about circle {ABCDE circle F}.

(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
