To inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon in a given circle.

Let {ABCDE circle O} be the given circle.
So it is required to inscribed an equilateral and equiangular pentagon in circle {ABCDE circle O}.

Let the the isosceles triangle {FGH polygon} be set up having each of the angles at {G point} and {H point} double the (angle) at {F point} [Prop. 4.10].
And let triangle {ACD polygon}, equiangular to {FGH polygon}, have been inscribed in circle {ABCDE circle O}, such that {CAD angle} is equal to the angle at {F point}, and the (angles) at {G point} and {H point} (are) equal to {ACD angle} and {CDA angle}, respectively [Prop. 4.2].
Thus, {ACD angle} and {CDA angle} are each double {CAD angle}.
So let {ACD angle} and {CDA angle} have been cut in half by the straight-lines {CE line} and {DB line}, respectively [Prop. 1.9].
And let {AB line}, {BC line}, {DE line} and {EA line} have been joined.

Therefore, since angles {ACD angle} and {CDA angle} are each double {CAD angle}, and are cut in half by the straight-lines {CE line} and {DB line}, the five angles {DAC angle}, {ACE angle}, {ECD angle}, {CDB angle}, and {BDA angle} are thus equal to one another.
And equal angles stand upon equal circumferences [Prop. 3.26].
Thus, the five circumferences {AB arcc O}, {BC arcc O}, {CD arcc O}, {DE arcc O}, and {EA arcc O} are equal to one another [Prop. 3.29].
Thus, the pentagon {ABCDE polygon} is equilateral.
So I say that (it is) also equiangular.
For since the circumference {AB arcc O} is equal to the circumference {DE arcc O}, let {BCD arcc O} have been added to both.
Thus, the whole circumference {ABCD arcc O} is equal to the whole circumference {EDCB arc O}.
And the angle {AED angle} stands upon circumference {ABCD arcc O}, and angle {BAE angle} upon circumference {EDCB arc O}.
Thus, angle {BAE angle} is also equal to {AED angle} [Prop. 3.27].
So, for the same (reasons), each of the angles {ABC angle}, {BCD angle}, and {CDE angle} is also equal to each of {BAE angle} and {AED angle}.
Thus, pentagon {ABCDE polygon} is equiangular.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.

Thus, an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been inscribed in the given circle.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
