To construct a square equal to a given rectilinear figure.

Let A be the given rectilinear figure.
So it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilinear figure A.

For let the right-angled parallelogram BD, equal to the rectilinear figure A, have been constructed [Prop. 1.45].
Therefore, if BE is equal to ED then that (which) was prescribed has taken place.
For the square BD, equal to the rectilinear figure A, has been constructed.
And if not, then one of the (straight-lines) BE or ED is greater (than the other).
Let BE be greater, and let it have been produced to F, and let EF be made equal to ED [Prop. 1.3].
And let BF have been cut in half at (point) G [Prop. 1.10].
And, with center G, and radius one of the (straight-lines) GB or GF, let the semi-circle BHF have been drawn.
And let DE have been produced to H, and let GH have been joined.

Therefore, since the straight-line BF has been cut--- equally at G, and unequally at E---the rectangle contained by BE and EF, plus the square on EG, is thus equal to the square on GF [Prop. 2.5].
And GF (is) equal to GH.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by BE and EF, plus the (square) on GE, is equal to the (square) on GH.
And the (sum of the) squares on HE and EG is equal to the (square) on GH [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by BE and EF, plus the (square) on GE, is equal to the (sum of the squares) on HE and EG.
Let the square on GE have been taken from both.
Thus, the remaining rectangle contained by BE and EF is equal to the square on EH.
But, BD is the (rectangle contained) by BE and EF.
For EF (is) equal to ED.
Thus, the parallelogram BD is equal to the square on HE.
And BD (is) equal to the rectilinear figure A.
Thus, the rectilinear figure A is also equal to the square (which) can be described on EH.

Thus, a square—(namely), that (which) can be de- scribed on EH—has been constructed, equal to the given rectilinear figure A.
(Which is) the very thing it was re- quired to do.
