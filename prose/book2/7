If a straight-line is cut at random then the sum of the squares on the whole (straight-line), and one of the pieces (of the straight-line), is equal to twice the rectangle contained by the whole, and the said piece, and the square on the remaining piece.

For let any straight-line {AB line} have been cut, at random, at point {C point}.
I say that the (sum of the) squares on {AB line} and {BC line} is equal to twice the rectangle contained by {AB line} and {BC line}, and the square on {CA line}.

For let the square {ADEB polygon} have been described on {AB line} [Prop. 1.46], and let the (rest of) the figure have been drawn.

Therefore, since (rectangle) {AHGC polygon} is equal to (rectangle) {GNEF polygon} [Prop. 1.43], let the (square) {CGFB polygon} have been added to both.
Thus, the whole (rectangle) {AHFB polygon} is equal to the whole (rectangle) {CNEB polygon}.
Thus, (rectangle) {AHFB polygon} plus (rectangle) {CNEB polygon} is double (rectangle) {AHFB polygon}.
But, (rectangle) {AHFB polygon} plus (rectangle) {CNEB polygon} is the gnomon {KLM given}, and the square {CGFB polygon}.
Thus, the gnomon {KLM given} , and the square {CGFB polygon}, is double the (rectangle) {AHFB polygon}.
But double the (rectangle) {AHFB polygon} is also twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line}.
For {BF line} (is) equal to {BC line}.
Thus, the gnomon {KLM given}, and the square {CGFB polygon}, are equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AB line} and {BC line}.
Let {DNGH polygon}, which is the square on {AC line}, have been added to both.
Thus, the gnomon {KLM given}, and the squares {BFGC polygon} and {GNDH polygon}, are equal to twice the rectangle contained by {AB line} and {BC line}, and the square on {AC line}.
But, the gnomon {KLM given} and the squares {BFGC polygon} and {GNDH polygon} is (equivalent to) the whole of {ADEB polygon} and {CGFB polygon}, which are the squares on {AB line} and {BC line} (respectively).
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on {AB line} and {BC line} is equal to twice the rectangle contained by {AB line} and {BC line}, and the square on {AC line}.

Thus, if a straight-line is cut at random then the sum of the squares on the whole (straight-line), and one of the pieces (of the straight-line), is equal to twice the rect- angle contained by the whole, and the said piece, and the square on the remaining piece.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

This proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity: (a + b)^2 + a = 2 (a + b) a + b^2.
