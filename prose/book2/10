If a straight-line is cut in half, and any straight-line added to it straight-on, then the sum of the square on the whole (straight-line) with the (straight-line) having been added, and the (square) on the (straight-line) having been added, is double the (sum of the square) on half (the straight-line), and the square described on the sum of half (the straight-line) and (straight-line) having been added, as on one (complete straight-line).

For let any straight-line {AB line} have been cut in half at (point) {C point}, and let any straight-line {BD line} have been added to it straight-on.
I say that the (sum of the) squares on {AD line} and {DB line} is double the (sum of the) squares on {AC line} and {CD line}.

For let {CE line} have been drawn from point {C point}, at right-angles to {AB line} [Prop. 1.11], and let it be made equal to each of {AC line} and {CB line} [Prop. 1.3], and let {EA line} and {EB line} have been joined.
And let {EF line} have been drawn through {E point}, parallel to {AD line} [Prop. 1.31], and let {FD line} have been drawn through {D point}, parallel to {CE line} [Prop. 1.31].
And since some straight-line {EF line} falls across the parallel straight-lines {EC line} and {FD line}, the (internal angles) {CEF angle} and {EFD angle} are thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
Thus, {FEB angle} and {EFD angle} are less than two right-angles.
And (straight-lines) produced from (internal angles whose sum is) less than two right-angles meet together [Post. 5].
Thus, being produced in the direction of {B point} and {D point}, the (straight-lines) {EB line} and {FD line} will meet.
Let them have been produced, and let them meet together at {G point}, and let {AG line} have been joined.
And since {AC line} is equal to {CE line}, angle {EAC angle} is also equal to (angle) {AEC angle} [Prop. 1.5].
And the (angle) at {C point} (is) a right-angle.
Thus, {EAC angle} and {AEC angle} [are] each half a right-angle [Prop. 1.32].
So, for the same (reasons), {CEB angle} and {EBC angle} are also each half a right-angle.
Thus, (angle) {AEB angle} is a right-angle.
And since {EBC angle} is half a right-angle, {DBG angle} (is) thus also half a right-angle [Prop. 1.15].
And {BDG angle} is also a right-angle.
For it is equal to {DCE angle}.
For (they are) alternate (angles) [Prop. 1.29].
Thus, the remaining (angle) {DGB angle} is half a right-angle.
Thus, {DGB angle} is equal to {DBG angle}.
So side {BD line} is also equal to side {GD line} [Prop. 1.6].
Again, since {EGF angle} is half a right-angle, and the (angle) at {F point} (is) a right-angle, for it is equal to the opposite (angle) at {C point} [Prop. 1.34], the remaining (angle) {FEG angle} is thus half a right-angle.
Thus, angle {EGF angle} (is) equal to {FEG angle}.
So the side {GF line} is also equal to the side {EF line} [Prop. 1.6].
And since [{EC line} is equal to {CA line}] the square on {EC line} is [also] equal to the square on {CA line}.
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on {EC line} and {CA line} is double the square on {CA line}.
And the (square) on {EA line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {EC line} and {CA line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the square on {EA line} is double the square on {AC line}.
Again, since {FG line} is equal to {EF line}, the (square) on {FG line} is also equal to the (square) on {FE line}.
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {GF line} and {FE line} is double the (square) on {EF line}.
And the (square) on {EG line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {GF line} and {FE line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (square) on {EG line} is double the (square) on {EF line}.
And {EF line} (is) equal to {CD line} [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, the square on {EG line} is double the (square) on {CD line}.
But it was also shown that the (square) on {EA line} (is) double the (square) on {AC line}.
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on {AE line} and {EG line} is double the (sum of the) squares on {AC line} and {CD line}.
And the square on {AG line} is equal to the (sum of the) squares on {AE line} and {EG line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (square) on {AG line} is double the (sum of the squares) on {AC line} and {CD line}.
And the (sum of the squares) on {AD line} and {DG line} is equal to the (square) on {AG line} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (sum of the) [squares] on {AD line} and {DG line} is double the (sum of the) [squares] on {AC line} and {CD line}.
And {DG line} (is) equal to {DB line}.
Thus, the (sum of the) [squares] on {AD line} and {DB line} is double the (sum of the) squares on {AC line} and {CD line}.

Thus, if a straight-line is cut in half, and any straight-line added to it straight-on, then the sum of the square on the whole (straight-line) with the (straight-line) having been added, and the (square) on the (straight-line) having been added, is double the (sum of the square) on half (the straight-line), and the square described on the sum of half (the straight-line) and (straight-line) having been added, as on one (complete straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
