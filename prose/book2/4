If a straight-line is cut at random then the square on the whole (straight-line) is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the pieces (of the straight-line), and twice the rectangle contained by the pieces.

For let the straight-line AB have been cut, at random, at (point) C. I say that the square on AB is equal to the (sum of the) squares on AC and CB, and twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB.

For let the square ADEB have been described on AB [Prop. 1.46], and let BD have been joined, and let CF have been drawn through C, parallel to either of AD or EB [Prop. 1.31], and let HK have been drawn through G, parallel to either of AB or DE [Prop. 1.31].
And since CF is parallel to AD, and BD has fallen across them, the external angle CGB is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) ADB [Prop. 1.29].
But, ADB is equal to ABD, since the side BA is also equal to AD [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, angle CGB is also equal to GBC.
So the side BC is equal to the side CG [Prop. 1.6].
But, CB is equal to GK, and CG to KB [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, GK is also equal to KB.
Thus, CGKB is equilateral.
So I say that (it is) also right-angled.
For since CG is parallel to BK [and the straight-line CB has fallen across them], the angles KBC and GCB are thus equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29].
But KBC (is) a right-angle.
Thus, BCG (is) also a rightangle.
So the opposite (angles) CGK and GKB are also right-angles [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, CGKB is right-angled.
And it was also shown (to be) equilateral.
Thus, it is a square.
And it is on CB.
So, for the same (reasons), HF is also a square.
And it is on HG, that is to say [on] AC [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, the squares HF and KC are on AC and CB (respectively).
And the (rectangle) AG is equal to the (rectangle) GE [Prop. 1.43].
And AG is the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB.
For GC (is) equal to CB.
Thus, GE is also equal to the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB.
Thus, the (rectangles) AG and GE are equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB.
And HF and CK are the squares on AC and CB (respectively).
Thus, the four (figures) HF, CK, AG, and GE are equal to the (sum of the) squares on AC and BC, and twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB.
But, the (figures) HF, CK, AG, and GE are (equivalent to) the whole of ADEB, which is the square on AB.
Thus, the square on AB is equal to the (sum of the) squares on AC and CB, and twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB.

Thus, if a straight-line is cut at random then the square on the whole (straight-line) is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the pieces (of the straight-line), and twice the rectangle contained by the pieces.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
