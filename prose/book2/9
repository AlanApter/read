If a straight-line is cut into equal and unequal (pieces) then the (sum of the) squares on the unequal pieces of the whole (straight-line) is double the (sum of the) square on half (the straight-line) and (the square) on the (difference) between the (equal and unequal) pieces.

For let any straight-line AB have been cut---equally at C, and unequally at D.
I say that the (sum of the) squares on AD and DB is double the (sum of the squares) on AC and CD.

For let CE have been drawn from (point) C, at right-angles to AB [Prop. 1.11], and let it be made equal to each of AC and CB [Prop. 1.3], and let EA and EB have been joined.
And let DF have been drawn through (point) D, parallel to EC [Prop. 1.31], and (let) FG (have been drawn) through (point) F, (parallel) to AB [Prop. 1.31].
And let AF have been joined.
And since AC is equal to CE, the angle EAC is also equal to the (angle) AEC [Prop. 1.5].
And since the (angle) at C is a right-angle, the (sum of the) remaining angles (of triangle AEC), EAC and AEC, is thus equal to one right-angle [Prop. 1.32].
And they are equal.
Thus, (angles) CEA and CAE are each half a right-angle.
So, for the same (reasons), (angles) CEB and EBC are also each half a right-angle.
Thus, the whole (angle) AEB is a right-angle.
And since GEF is half a right-angle, and EGF (is) a right-angle—for it is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) ECB [Prop. 1.29]—the remaining (angle) EFG is thus half a right-angle [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, angle GEF [is] equal to EFG.
So the side EG is also equal to the (side) GF [Prop. 1.6].
Again, since the angle at B is half a right-angle, and (angle) FDB (is) a right-angle---for again it is equal to the internal and opposite (angle) ECB [Prop. 1.29]--- the remaining (angle) BFD is half a right-angle [Prop. 1.32].
Thus, the angle at B (is) equal to DFB.
So the side FD is also equal to the side DB [Prop. 1.6].
And since AC is equal to CE, the (square) on AC (is) also equal to the (square) on CE.
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on AC and CE is dou- ble the (square) on AC.
And the square on EA is equal to the (sum of the) squares on AC and CE.
For angle ACE (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (square) on EA is double the (square) on AC.
Again, since EG is equal to GF, the (square) on EG (is) also equal to the (square) on GF.
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on EG and GF is double the square on GF.
And the square on EF is equal to the (sum of the) squares on EG and GF [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the square on EF is double the (square) on GF.
And GF (is) equal to CD [Prop. 1.34].
Thus, the (square) on EF is double the (square) on CD.
And the (square) on EA is also double the (square) on AC.
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on AE and EF is double the (sum of the) squares on AC and CD.
And the square on AF is equal to the (sum of the squares) on AE and EF.
For the angle AEF is a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the square on AF is double the (sum of the squares) on AC and CD.
And the (sum of the squares) on AD and DF (is) equal to the (square) on AF.
For the angle at D is a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on AD and DF is double the (sum of the) squares on AC and CD.
And DF (is) equal to DB.
Thus, the (sum of the) squares on AD and DB is double the (sum of the) squares on AC and CD.

Thus, if a straight-line is cut into equal and unequal (pieces) then the (sum of the) squares on the unequal pieces of the whole (straight-line) is double the (sum of the) square on half (the straight-line) and (the square) on the (difference) between the (equal and unequal) pieces.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
