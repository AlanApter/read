If there are two straight-lines, and one of them is cut into any number of pieces whatsoever, then the rectangle contained by the two straight-lines is equal to the (sum of the) rectangles contained by the uncut (straight-line), and every one of the pieces (of the cut straight-line).

Let A and BC be the two straight-lines, and let BC be cut, at random, at points D and E.
I say that the rectangle contained by A and BC is equal to the rectangle(s) contained by A and BD, by A and DE, and, finally, by A and EC.

For let BF have been drawn from point B, at right-angles to BC [Prop. 1.11], and let BG be made equal to A [Prop. 1.3], and let GH have been drawn through (point) G, parallel to BC [Prop. 1.31], and let DK, EL, and CH have been drawn through (points) D, E, and C (respectively), parallel to BG [Prop. 1.31].

So the (rectangle) BH is equal to the (rectangles) BK, DL, and EH.
And BH is the (rectangle contained) by A and BC.
For it is contained by GB and BC, and BG (is) equal to A.
And BK (is) the (rectangle contained) by A and BD.
For it is contained by GB and BD, and BG (is) equal to A.
And DL (is) the (rectangle contained) by A and DE.
For DK, that is to say BG [Prop. 1.34], (is) equal to A.
Similarly, EH (is) also the (rectangle contained) by A and EC.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by A and BC is equal to the (rectangles contained) by A and BD, by A and DE, and, finally, by A and EC.

Thus, if there are two straight-lines, and one of them is cut into any number of pieces whatsoever, then the rectangle contained by the two straight-lines is equal to the (sum of the) rectangles contained by the uncut (straight-line), and every one of the pieces (of the cut straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
