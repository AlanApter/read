If a straight-line is cut at random then the rectangle contained by the whole (straight-line), and one of the pieces (of the straight-line), is equal to the rectangle con- tained by (both of) the pieces, and the square on the aforementioned piece.

For let the straight-line {AB line} have been cut, at random, at (point) {C point}.
I say that the rectangle contained by {AB line} and {BC line} is equal to the rectangle contained by {AC line} and {CB line}, plus the square on {BC line}.

For let the square {CDEB polygon} have been described on {CB line} [Prop. 1.46], and let {ED line} have been drawn through to {F point}, and let {AF line} have been drawn through {A point}, parallel to either of {CD line} or {BE line} [Prop. 1.31].
So the (rectangle) {AFEB polygon} is equal to the (rectangle) {AFDC polygon} and the (square) {CDEB polygon}.
And {AFEB polygon} is the rectangle contained by {AB line} and {BC line}.
For it is contained by {AB line} and {BE line}, and {BE line} (is) equal to {BC line}.
And {AFDC polygon} (is) the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line}.
For {DC line} (is) equal to {CB line}.
And {DEBC polygon} (is) the square on {CB line}.
Thus, the rectangle contained by {AB line} and {BC line} is equal to the rectangle contained by {AC line} and {CB line}, plus the square on {BC line}.

Thus, if a straight-line is cut at random then the rectangle contained by the whole (straight-line), and one of the pieces (of the straight-line), is equal to the rectangle contained by (both of) the pieces, and the square on the aforementioned piece.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

This proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity: (a + b) a = a b + a .
