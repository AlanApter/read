There exists one number in mean proportion to two similar plane numbers.
And (one) plane (number) has to the (other) plane (number) a squared ratio with respect to (that) a corresponding side (of the former has) to a corresponding side (of the latter).

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be two similar plane numbers.
And let the numbers {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} be the sides of {A magnitude}, and {E magnitude}, {F magnitude} (the sides) of {B magnitude}.
And since similar numbers are those having proportional sides [Def. 7.21], thus as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}.
Therefore, I say that there exists one number in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, and that {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to that {C magnitude} (has) to {E magnitude}, or {D magnitude} to {F magnitude} ---that is to say, with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding [side].

For since as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, thus, alternately, as {C magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.13].
And since {A magnitude} is plane, and {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} its sides, {D magnitude} has thus made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}.
And so, for the same (reasons), {E magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}.
So let {D magnitude} make {G magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}.
And since {D magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}, and has made {G magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}, thus as {C magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
But as {C magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, [so] {D magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}.
And thus as {D magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}.
Again, since {E magnitude} has made {G magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}, and has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}, thus as {D magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {G magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And it was also shown that as {D magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}.
And thus as {A magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, so {G magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude}, {G magnitude}, {B magnitude} are continously proportional.
Thus, there exists one number (namely, {G magnitude}) in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.

So I say that {A magnitude} also has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to (that) a corresponding side (has) to a corresponding side---that is to say, with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {E magnitude}, or {D magnitude} to {F magnitude}.
For since {A magnitude}, {G magnitude}, {B magnitude} are continuously proportional, {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to (that {A magnitude} has) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 5.9].
And as {A magnitude} is to {G magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, and {D magnitude} to {F magnitude}.
And thus {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {E magnitude}, or {D magnitude} to {F magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
