If two numbers fall between two numbers in mean proportion then the (latter) are similar solid (numbers).

For let the two numbers C and D fall between the two numbers A and B in mean proportion.
I say that A and B are similar solid (numbers).

For let the three least numbers E, F, G having the same ratio as A, C, D have been taken [Prop. 8.2].
Thus, the outermost of them, E and G, are prime to one another [Prop. 8.3].
And since one number, F, has fallen (between) E and G in mean proportion, E and G are

thus similar plane numbers [Prop. 8.20].
Therefore, let H, K be the sides of E, and L, M (the sides) of G.
Thus, it is clear from the (proposition) before this (one) that E, F, G are continuously proportional in the ratio of H to L, and of K to M.
And since E, F, G are the least (numbers) having the same ratio as A, C, D, and the multitude of E, F, G is equal to the multitude of A, C, D, thus, via equality, as E is to G, so A (is) to D [Prop. 7.14].
And E and G (are) prime (to one another), and prime (numbers) are also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as them) [Prop. 7.21], and the least (numbers) measure those (numbers) having the same ratio as them an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser---that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [Prop. 7.20].
Thus, E measures A the same number of times as G (measures) D.
So as many times as E measures A, so many units let there be in N.
Thus, N has made A (by) multiplying E [Def. 7.15].
And E is the (number created) from (multiplying) H and K.
Thus, N has made A (by) multiplying the (number created) from (multiplying) H and K.
Thus, A is solid, and its sides are H, K, N.
Again, since E, F, G are the least (numbers) having the same ratio as C, D, B, thus E measures C the same number of times as G (measures) B [Prop. 7.20].
So as many times as E measures C, so many units let there be in O.
Thus, G measures B according to the units in O.
Thus, O has made B (by) multiplying G.
And G is the (number created) from (multiplying) L and M.
Thus, O has made B (by) multiplying the (number created) from (multiplying) L and M.
Thus, B is solid, and its sides are L, M, O.
Thus, A and B are (both) solid.

[So] I say that (they are) also similar.
For since N, O have made A, C (by) multiplying E, thus as N is to O, so A(is) to C---that is to say, E to F [Prop. 7.18].
But, as E (is) to F, so H (is) to L, and K to M.
And thus as H (is) to L, so K (is) to M, and N to O.
And H, K, N are the sides of A, and L, M, O the sides of B.
Thus, A and B are similar solid numbers [Def. 7.21].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
