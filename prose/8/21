If two numbers fall between two numbers in mean proportion then the (latter) are similar solid (numbers).

For let the two numbers {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} fall between the two numbers {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion.
I say that {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar solid (numbers).

For let the three least numbers {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 8.2].
Thus, the outermost of them, {E magnitude} and {G magnitude}, are prime to one another [Prop. 8.3].
And since one number, {F magnitude}, has fallen (between) {E magnitude} and {G magnitude} in mean proportion, {E magnitude} and {G magnitude} are thus similar plane numbers [Prop. 8.20].
Therefore, let {H magnitude}, {K magnitude} be the sides of {E magnitude}, and {L magnitude}, {M magnitude} (the sides) of {G magnitude}.
Thus, it is clear from the (proposition) before this (one) that {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} are continuously proportional in the ratio of {H magnitude} to {L magnitude}, and of {K magnitude} to {M magnitude}.
And since {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} are the least (numbers) having the same ratio as {A magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, and the multitude of {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} is equal to the multitude of {A magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, thus, via equality, as {E magnitude} is to {G magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.14].
And {E magnitude} and {G magnitude} (are) prime (to one another), and prime (numbers) are also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as them) [Prop. 7.21], and the least (numbers) measure those (numbers) having the same ratio as them an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser---that is to say, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [Prop. 7.20].
Thus, {E magnitude} measures {A magnitude} the same number of times as {G magnitude} (measures) {D magnitude}.
So as many times as {E magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, so many units let there be in {N magnitude}.
Thus, {N magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
And {E magnitude} is the (number created) from (multiplying) {H magnitude} and {K magnitude}.
Thus, {N magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying the (number created) from (multiplying) {H magnitude} and {K magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} is solid, and its sides are {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {N magnitude}.
Again, since {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} are the least (numbers) having the same ratio as {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {B magnitude}, thus {E magnitude} measures {C magnitude} the same number of times as {G magnitude} (measures) {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.20].
So as many times as {E magnitude} measures {C magnitude}, so many units let there be in {O magnitude}.
Thus, {G magnitude} measures {B magnitude} according to the units in {O magnitude}.
Thus, {O magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {G magnitude}.
And {G magnitude} is the (number created) from (multiplying) {L magnitude} and {M magnitude}.
Thus, {O magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying the (number created) from (multiplying) {L magnitude} and {M magnitude}.
Thus, {B magnitude} is solid, and its sides are {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, {O magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are (both) solid.

[So] I say that (they are) also similar.
For since {N magnitude}, {O magnitude} have made {A magnitude}, {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}, thus as {N magnitude} is to {O magnitude}, so {A magnitude}(is) to {C magnitude}---that is to say, {E magnitude} to {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.18].
But, as {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, and {K magnitude} to {M magnitude}.
And thus as {H magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, so {K magnitude} (is) to {M magnitude}, and {N magnitude} to {O magnitude}.
And {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {N magnitude} are the sides of {A magnitude}, and {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, {O magnitude} the sides of {B magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar solid numbers [Def. 7.21].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
