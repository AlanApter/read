If a cube number does not measure a(nother) cube number then the side (of the former) will not measure the side (of the latter) either.
And if the side (of a cube number) does not measure the side (of another cube number) then the (former) cube (number) will not measure the (latter) cube (number) either.

For let the cube number A not measure the cube number B.
And let C be the side of A, and D (the side) of B.
I say that C will not measure D.

For if C measures D then A will also measure B [Prop. 8.15].
And A does not measure B.
Thus, C does not measure D either.

And so let C not measure D.
I say that A will not measure B either.
For if A measures B then C will also measure D [Prop. 8.15].
And C does not measure D.
Thus, A will not measure B either.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
