If a square number does not measure a(nother) square number then the side (of the former) will not measure the side (of the latter) either.
And if the side (of a square number) does not measure the side (of another square number) then the (former) square (number) will not measure the (latter) square (number) either.

Let A and B be square numbers, and let C and D be their sides (respectively).
And let A not measure B.
I say that C does not measure D either.

For if C measures D then A will also measure B [Prop. 8.14].
And A does not measure B.
Thus, C will not measure D either.

[So], again, let C not measure D.
I say that A will not measure B either.

For if A measures B then C will also measure D [Prop. 8.14].
And C does not measure D.
Thus, A will not measure B either.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
