If a square number does not measure a(nother) square number then the side (of the former) will not measure the side (of the latter) either.
And if the side (of a square number) does not measure the side (of another square number) then the (former) square (number) will not measure the (latter) square (number) either.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be square numbers, and let {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} be their sides (respectively).
And let {A magnitude} not measure {B magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} does not measure {D magnitude} either.

For if {C magnitude} measures {D magnitude} then {A magnitude} will also measure {B magnitude} [Prop. 8.14].
And {A magnitude} does not measure {B magnitude}.
Thus, {C magnitude} will not measure {D magnitude} either.

[So], again, let {C magnitude} not measure {D magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} will not measure {B magnitude} either.

For if {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude} then {C magnitude} will also measure {D magnitude} [Prop. 8.14].
And {C magnitude} does not measure {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} will not measure {B magnitude} either.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
