If four numbers are continuously proportional, and the first is cube, then the fourth will also be cube.

Let A, B, C, D be four continuously proportional numbers, and let A be cube.
I say that D is also cube.

For since two numbers, B and C, are in mean proportion to A and D, A and D are thus similar solid numbers [Prop. 8.21].
And A (is) cube.
Thus, D (is) also cube [Def. 7.21].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
