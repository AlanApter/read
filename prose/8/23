If four numbers are continuously proportional, and the first is cube, then the fourth will also be cube.

Let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} be four continuously proportional numbers, and let {A magnitude} be cube.
I say that {D magnitude} is also cube.

For since two numbers, {B magnitude} and {C magnitude}, are in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {D magnitude}, {A magnitude} and {D magnitude} are thus similar solid numbers [Prop. 8.21].
And {A magnitude} (is) cube.
Thus, {D magnitude} (is) also cube [Def. 7.21].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
