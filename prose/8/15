If a cube number measures a(nother) cube number then the side (of the former) will also measure the side (of the latter).
And if the side (of a cube number) measures the side (of another cube number) then the (former) cube (number) will also measure the (latter) cube (number).

For let the cube number {A magnitude} measure the cube (number) {B magnitude}, and let {C magnitude} be the side of {A magnitude}, and {D magnitude} (the side) of {B magnitude}.
I say that {C magnitude} measures {D magnitude}.

For let {C magnitude} make {E magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
And let {D magnitude} make {G magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
And, further, [let] {C magnitude} [make] {F magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}, and let {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} make {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, respectively, (by) multiplying {F magnitude}.
So it is clear that {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {G magnitude} and {A magnitude}, {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {B magnitude} are continuously proportional in the ratio of {C magnitude} to {D magnitude} [Prop. 8.12].
And since {A magnitude}, {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {B magnitude} are continuously proportional, and {A magnitude} measures {B magnitude}, ({A magnitude}) thus also measures {H magnitude} [Prop. 8.7].
And as {A magnitude} is to {H magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
Thus, {C magnitude} also measures {D magnitude} [Def. 7.20].

And so let {C magnitude} measure {D magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} will also measure {B magnitude}.

For similarly, with the same construction, we can show that {A magnitude}, {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {B magnitude} are continuously proportional in the ratio of {C magnitude} to {D magnitude}.
And since {C magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, and as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {H magnitude}, {A magnitude} thus also measures {H magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
Hence, {A magnitude} also measures {B magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
