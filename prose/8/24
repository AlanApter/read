If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number (has) to a(nother) square number, and the first is square, then the second will also be square.

For let two numbers, A and B, have to one another the ratio which the square number C (has) to the square number D.
And let A be square.
I say that B is also square.

For since C and D are square, C and D are thus similar plane (numbers).
Thus, one number falls (between) C and D in mean proportion [Prop. 8.18].
And as C is to D, (so) A (is) to B.
Thus, one number also falls (between) A and B in mean proportion [Prop. 8.8].
And A is square.
Thus, B is also square [Prop. 8.22].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
