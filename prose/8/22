If three numbers are continuously proportional, and the first is square, then the third will also be square.

Let A, B, C be three continuously proportional numbers, and let the first A be square.
I say that the third C is also square.

For since one number, B, is in mean proportion to A and C, A and C are thus similar plane (numbers) [Prop. 8.20].
And A is square.
Thus, C is also square [Def. 7.21].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
