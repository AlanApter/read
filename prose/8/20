If one number falls between two numbers in mean proportion then the numbers will be similar plane (numbers).

For let one number {C magnitude} fall between the two numbers {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion.
I say that {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar plane numbers.

[For] let the least numbers, {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}, having the same ratio as {A magnitude} and {C magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 7.33].
Thus, {D magnitude} measures {A magnitude} as many times as {E magnitude} (measures) {C magnitude} [Prop. 7.20].
So as many times as {D magnitude} measures {A magnitude}, so many units let there be in {F magnitude}.
Thus, {F magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
Hence, {A magnitude} is plane, and {D magnitude}, {F magnitude} (are) its sides.
Again, since {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} are the least of those (numbers) having the same ratio as {C magnitude} and {B magnitude}, {D magnitude} thus measures {C magnitude} as many times as {E magnitude} (measures) {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.20].
So as many times as {E magnitude} measures {B magnitude}, so many units let there be in {G magnitude}.
Thus, {E magnitude} measures {B magnitude} according to the units in {G magnitude}.
Thus, {G magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude} [Def. 7.15].
Thus, {B magnitude} is plane, and {E magnitude}, {G magnitude} are its sides.
Thus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are (both) plane numbers.
So I say that (they are) also similar.
For since {F magnitude} has made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}, and has made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}, thus as {D magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}---that is to say, {C magnitude} to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
Again, since {E magnitude} has made {C magnitude}, {B magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}, {G magnitude}, respectively, thus as {F magnitude} is to {G magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And as {C magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.
And thus as {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}.
And, alternately, as {D magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 7.13].
Thus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are similar plane numbers.
For their sides are proportional [Def. 7.21].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
