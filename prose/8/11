There exists one number in mean proportion to two (given) square numbers.
And (one) square (number) has to the (other) square (number) a squared ratio with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter).

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be square numbers, and let {C magnitude} be the side of {A magnitude}, and {D magnitude} (the side) of {B magnitude}.
I say that there exists one number in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, and that {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {D magnitude}.

For let {C magnitude} make {E magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.
And since {A magnitude} is square, and {C magnitude} is its side, {C magnitude} has thus made {A magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
And so, for the same (reasons), {D magnitude} has made {B magnitude} (by) multiplying itself.
Therefore, since {C magnitude} has made {A magnitude}, {E magnitude} (by) multiplying {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, respectively, thus as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {A magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].
And so, for the same (reasons), as {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Prop. 7.18].
And thus as {A magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}.
Thus, one number (namely, {E magnitude}) is in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.

So I say that {A magnitude} also has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to (that) {C magnitude} (has) to {D magnitude}.
For since {A magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {B magnitude} are three (continuously) proportional numbers, {A magnitude} thus has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to (that) {A magnitude} (has) to {E magnitude} [Def. 5.9].
And as {A magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} a squared ratio with respect to (that) side {C magnitude} (has) to (side) {D magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
