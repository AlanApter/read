There exists one number in mean proportion to two (given) square numbers.
And (one) square (number) has to the (other) square (number) a squared ratio with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter).

Let A and B be square numbers, and let C be the side of A, and D (the side) of B.
I say that there exists one number in mean proportion to A and B, and that A has to B a squared ratio with respect to (that) C (has) to D.

For let C make E (by) multiplying D.
And since A is square, and C is its side, C has thus made A (by) multiplying itself.
And so, for the same (reasons), D has made B (by) multiplying itself.
Therefore, since C has made A, E (by) multiplying C, D, respectively, thus as C is to D, so A (is) to E [Prop. 7.17].
And so, for the same (reasons), as C (is) to D, so E (is) to B [Prop. 7.18].
And thus as A (is) to E, so E (is) to B.
Thus, one number (namely, E) is in mean proportion to A and B.

So I say that A also has to B a squared ratio with respect to (that) C (has) to D.
For since A, E, B are three (continuously) proportional numbers, A thus has to B a squared ratio with respect to (that) A (has) to E [Def. 5.9].
And as A (is) to E, so C (is) to D.
Thus, A has to B a squared ratio with respect to (that) side C (has) to (side) D.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
