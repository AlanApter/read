If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number (has) to a(nother) cube number, and the first is cube, then the second will also be cube.

For let two numbers, A and B, have to one another the ratio which the cube number C (has) to the cube number D.
And let A be cube.
[So] I say that B is also cube.

For since C and D are cube (numbers), C and D are (thus) similar solid (numbers).
Thus, two numbers fall (between) C and D in mean proportion [Prop. 8.19].
And as many (numbers) as fall in between C and D in continued proportion, so many also (fall) in (between) those (numbers) having the same ratio as them (in continued proportion) [Prop. 8.8].
And hence two numbers fall (between) A and B in mean proportion.
Let E and F (so) fall.
Therefore, since the four numbers A, E, F, B are continuously proportional, and A is cube, B (is) thus also cube [Prop. 8.23].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
