If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number (has) to a(nother) cube number, and the first is cube, then the second will also be cube.

For let two numbers, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}, have to one another the ratio which the cube number {C magnitude} (has) to the cube number {D magnitude}.
And let {A magnitude} be cube.
[So] I say that {B magnitude} is also cube.

For since {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} are cube (numbers), {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} are (thus) similar solid (numbers).
Thus, two numbers fall (between) {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} in mean proportion [Prop. 8.19].
And as many (numbers) as fall in between {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} in continued proportion, so many also (fall) in (between) those (numbers) having the same ratio as them (in continued proportion) [Prop. 8.8].
And hence two numbers fall (between) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} in mean proportion.
Let {E magnitude} and {F magnitude} (so) fall.
Therefore, since the four numbers {A magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {F magnitude}, {B magnitude} are continuously proportional, and {A magnitude} is cube, {B magnitude} (is) thus also cube [Prop. 8.23].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
