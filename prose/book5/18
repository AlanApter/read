If separated magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional (when) composed.

Let AE, EB, CF, and FD be separated magnitudes (which are) proportional, (so that) as AE (is) to EB, so CF (is) to FD.
I say that they will also be proportional (when) composed, (so that) as AB (is) to BE, so CD (is) to FD.
For if (it is) not (the case that) as AB is to BE, so CD (is) to FD, then it will surely be (the case that) as AB (is) to BE, so CD is either to some (magnitude) less than DF, or (some magnitude) greater (than DF).

Let it, first of all, be to (some magnitude) less (than DF), (namely) DG.
And since composed magnitudes are proportional, (so that) as AB is to BE, so CD (is) to DG, they will thus also be proportional (when) separated [Prop. 5.17].
Thus, as AE is to EB, so CG (is) to GD.
But it was also assumed that as AE (is) to EB, so CF (is) to FD.
Thus, (it is) also (the case that) as CG (is) to GD, so CF (is) to FD [Prop. 5.11].
And the first (magnitude) CG (is) greater than the third CF.
Thus, the second (magnitude) GD (is) also greater than the fourth FD [Prop. 5.14].
But (it is) also less.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, (it is) not (the case that) as AB is to BE, so CD (is) to less than FD.
Similarly, we can show that neither (is it the case) to greater (than FD).
Thus, (it is the case) to the same (as F D).

Thus, if separated magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional (when) composed.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
