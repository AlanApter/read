If as the whole is to the whole so the (part) taken away is to the (part) taken away then the remainder to the remainder will also be as the whole (is) to the whole.

For let the whole {AB magnitude} be to the whole {CD magnitude} as the (part) taken away {AE magnitude} (is) to the (part) taken away {CF magnitude}.
I say that the remainder {EB magnitude} to the remainder {FD magnitude} will also be as the whole {AB magnitude} (is) to the whole {CD magnitude}.

For since as {AB magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, so {AE magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude}, (it is) also (the case), alternately, (that) as {BA magnitude} (is) to {AE magnitude}, so {DC magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].
And since composed magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional (when) separated, (so that) as {BE magnitude} (is) to {EA magnitude}, so {DF magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude} [Prop. 5.17].
Also, alternately, as {BE magnitude} (is) to {DF magnitude}, so {EA magnitude} (is) to {FC magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].
And it was assumed that as {AE magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude}, so the whole {AB magnitude} (is) to the whole {CD magnitude}.
And, thus, as the remainder {EB magnitude} (is) to the remainder {FD magnitude}, so the whole {AB magnitude} will be to the whole {CD magnitude}.


Thus, if as the whole is to the whole so the (part) taken away is to the (part) taken away then the remainder to the remainder will also be as the whole (is) to the whole.
[And since it was shown (that) as {AB magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude}, so {EB magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}, (it is) also (the case), alternately, (that) as {AB magnitude} (is) to {BE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} (is) to {FD magnitude}.
Thus, composed magnitudes are proportional.
And it was shown (that) as {BA magnitude} (is) to {AE magnitude}, so {DC magnitude} (is) to {CF magnitude}.
And (the latter) is converted (from the former).]

Corollary

So (it is) clear, from this, that if composed magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional (when) converted.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
