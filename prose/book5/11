(Ratios which are) the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another.

For let it be that as A (is) to B, so C (is) to D, and as C (is) to D, so E (is) to F.
I say that as A is to B, so E (is) to F.

For let the equal multiples G, H, K have been taken of A, C, E (respectively), and the other random equal multiples L, M, N of B, D, F (respectively).

And since as A is to B, so C (is) to D, and the equal multiples G and H have been taken of A and C (respectively), and the other random equal multiples L and M of B and D (respectively), thus if G exceeds L then H also exceeds M, and if (G is) equal (to L then H is also) equal (to M), and if (G is) less (than L then H is also) less (than M) [Def. 5.5].
Again, since as C is to D, so E (is) to F, and the equal multiples H and K have been taken of C and E (respectively), and the other random equal multiples M and N of D and F (respectively), thus if H exceeds M then K also exceeds N, and if (H is) equal (to M then K is also) equal (to N), and if (H is) less (than M then K is also) less (than N) [Def. 5.5].
But (we saw that) if H was exceeding M then G was also exceeding L, and if (H was) equal (to M then G was also) equal (to L), and if (H was) less (than M then G was also) less (than L).
And, hence, if G exceeds L then K also exceeds N, and if (G is) equal (to L then K is also) equal (to N), and if (G is) less (than L then K is also) less (than N).
And G and K are equal multiples of A and E (respectively), and L and N other random equal multiples of B and F (respectively).
Thus, as A is to B, so E (is) to F [Def. 5.5].

Thus, (ratios which are) the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
