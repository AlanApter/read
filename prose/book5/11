(Ratios which are) the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another.

For let it be that as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, and as {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}.
I say that as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}.

For let the equal multiples {G magnitude}, {H magnitude}, {K magnitude} have been taken of {A magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {E magnitude} (respectively), and the other random equal multiples {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, {N magnitude} of {B magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {F magnitude} (respectively).

And since as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, and the equal multiples {G magnitude} and {H magnitude} have been taken of {A magnitude} and {C magnitude} (respectively), and the other random equal multiples {L magnitude} and {M magnitude} of {B magnitude} and {D magnitude} (respectively), thus if {G magnitude} exceeds {L magnitude} then {H magnitude} also exceeds {M magnitude}, and if ({G magnitude} is) equal (to {L magnitude} then {H magnitude} is also) equal (to {M magnitude}), and if ({G magnitude} is) less (than {L magnitude} then {H magnitude} is also) less (than {M magnitude}) [Def. 5.5].
Again, since as {C magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, and the equal multiples {H magnitude} and {K magnitude} have been taken of {C magnitude} and {E magnitude} (respectively), and the other random equal multiples {M magnitude} and {N magnitude} of {D magnitude} and {F magnitude} (respectively), thus if {H magnitude} exceeds {M magnitude} then {K magnitude} also exceeds {N magnitude}, and if ({H magnitude} is) equal (to {M magnitude} then {K magnitude} is also) equal (to {N magnitude}), and if ({H magnitude} is) less (than {M magnitude} then {K magnitude} is also) less (than {N magnitude}) [Def. 5.5].
But (we saw that) if {H magnitude} was exceeding {M magnitude} then {G magnitude} was also exceeding {L magnitude}, and if ({H magnitude} was) equal (to {M magnitude} then {G magnitude} was also) equal (to {L magnitude}), and if ({H magnitude} was) less (than {M magnitude} then {G magnitude} was also) less (than {L magnitude}).
And, hence, if {G magnitude} exceeds {L magnitude} then {K magnitude} also exceeds {N magnitude}, and if ({G magnitude} is) equal (to {L magnitude} then {K magnitude} is also) equal (to {N magnitude}), and if ({G magnitude} is) less (than {L magnitude} then {K magnitude} is also) less (than {N magnitude}).
And {G magnitude} and {K magnitude} are equal multiples of {A magnitude} and {E magnitude} (respectively), and {L magnitude} and {N magnitude} other random equal multiples of {B magnitude} and {F magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude} [Def. 5.5].

Thus, (ratios which are) the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
