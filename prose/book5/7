Equal (magnitudes) have the same ratio to the same (magnitude), and the latter (magnitude has the same ratio) to the equal (magnitudes).

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be equal magnitudes, and {C magnitude} some other random magnitude.
I say that {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} each have the same ratio to {C magnitude}, and (that) {C magnitude} (has the same ratio) to each of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.

For let the equal multiples {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} have been taken of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (respectively), and the other random multiple {F magnitude} of {C magnitude}.

Therefore, since {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} are equal multiples of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (respectively), and {A magnitude} (is) equal to {B magnitude}, {D magnitude} (is) thus also equal to {E magnitude}.
And {F magnitude} (is) different, at random.
Thus, if {D magnitude} exceeds {F magnitude} then {E magnitude} also exceeds {F magnitude}, and if ({D magnitude} is) equal (to {F magnitude} then {E magnitude} is also) equal (to {F magnitude}), and if ({D magnitude} is) less (than {F magnitude} then {E magnitude} is also) less (than {F magnitude}).
And {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} are equal multiples of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (respectively), and {F magnitude} another random multiple of {C magnitude}.
Thus, as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude} [Def. 5.5].

[So] I say that {C magnitude} also has the same ratio to each of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.

For, similarly, we can show, by the same construction, that {D magnitude} is equal to {E magnitude}.
And {F magnitude} (has) some other (value).
Thus, if {F magnitude} exceeds {D magnitude} then it also exceeds {E magnitude}, and if ({F magnitude} is) equal (to {D magnitude} then it is also) equal (to {E magnitude}), and if ({F magnitude} is) less (than {D magnitude} then it is also) less (than {E magnitude}).
And {F magnitude} is a multiple of {C magnitude}, and {D magnitude} and {E magnitude} other random equal multiples of {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.
Thus, as {C magnitude} (is) to {A magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude} [Def. 5.5].

Thus, equal (magnitudes) have the same ratio to the same (magnitude), and the latter (magnitude has the same ratio) to the equal (magnitudes).

Corollary

So (it is) clear, from this, that if some magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional inversely.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
