Parts have the same ratio as similar multiples, taken in corresponding order.

For let AB and DE be equal multiples of C and F (respectively).
I say that as C is to F, so AB (is) to DE.

For since AB and DE are equal multiples of C and F (respectively), thus as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to C, so many (are there) also in DE equal to F.
Let AB have been divided into (magnitudes) AG, GH, HB, equal to C, and DE into (magnitudes) DK, KL, LE, equal to F.
So, the number of (magnitudes) AG, GH, HB will equal the number of (magnitudes) DK, KL, LE.
And since AG, GH, HB are equal to one another, and DK, KL, LE are also equal to one another, thus as AG is to DK, so GH (is) to KL, and HB to LE [Prop. 5.7].
And, thus (for proportional magnitudes), as one of the leading (magnitudes) will be to one of the following, so all of the leading (magnitudes will be) to all of the following [Prop. 5.12].
Thus, as AG is to DK, so AB (is)to DE.
And AG is equal to C, and DK to F.
Thus, as C is to F, so AB (is) to DE.

Thus, parts have the same ratio as similar multiples, taken in corresponding order.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
