For (magnitudes) having a ratio to the same (magnitude), that (magnitude which) has the greater ratio is (the) greater.
And that (magnitude) to which the latter (magnitude) has a greater ratio is (the) lesser.

For let A have a greater ratio to C than B (has) to C.
I say that A is greater than B.

For if not, A is surely either equal to or less than B.
In fact, A is not equal to B.
For (then) A and B would each have the same ratio to C [Prop. 5.7].
But they do not.
Thus, A is not equal to B.
Neither, indeed, is A less than B.
For (then) A would have a lesser ratio to C than B (has) to C [Prop. 5.8].
But it does not.
Thus, A is not less than B.
And it was shown not (to be) equal either.
Thus, A is greater than B.

So, again, let C have a greater ratio to B than C (has) to A.
I say that B is less than A.

For if not, (it is) surely either equal or greater.
In fact, B is not equal to A.
For (then) C would have the same ratio to each of A and B [Prop.5.7].
But it does not.
Thus, A is not equal to B.
Neither, indeed, is B greater than A.
For (then) C would have a lesser ratio to B than (it has) to A [Prop. 5.8].
But it does not.
Thus, B is not greater than A.
And it was shown that (it is) not equal (to A) either.
Thus, B is less than A.

Thus, for (magnitudes) having a ratio to the same (magnitude), that (magnitude which) has the greater ratio is (the) greater.
And that (magnitude) to which the latter (magnitude) has a greater ratio is (the) lesser.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
