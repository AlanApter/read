For any triangle, the greater side subtends the greater angle.

For let {ABC polygon} be a triangle having side {AC line} greater than {AB line}.
I say that angle {ABC angle} is also greater than {BCA angle}.

For since {AC line} is greater than {AB line}, let {AD line} be made equal to {AB line} [Prop. 1.3], and let {BD line} have been joined.

And since angle {ADB angle} is external to triangle {BCD polygon}, it is greater than the internal and opposite (angle) {DCB angle} [Prop. 1.16].
But {ADB angle} (is) equal to {ABD angle}, since side {AB line} is also equal to side {AD line} [Prop. 1.5].
Thus, {ABD angle} is also greater than {ACB angle}.
Thus, {ABC angle} is much greater than {ACB angle}.

Thus, for any triangle, the greater side subtends the greater angle. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
