If two magnitudes are commensurable, and one of them is incommensurable with some magnitude, then the remaining (magnitude) will also be incommensurable with it.

Let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be two commensurable magnitudes, and let one of them, {A magnitude}, be incommensurable with some other (magnitude), {C magnitude}.
I say that the remaining (magnitude), {B magnitude}, is also incommensurable with {C magnitude}.

For if {B magnitude} is commensurable with {C magnitude}, but {A magnitude} is also commensurable with {B magnitude}, {A magnitude} is thus also commensurable with {C magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].
But, (it is) also incommensurable (with {C magnitude}).
The very thing (is) impossible.
Thus, {B magnitude} is not commensurable with {C magnitude}.
Thus, (it is) incommensurable.

Thus, if two magnitudes are commensurable, and so on ....
