If two magnitudes are commensurable, and one of them is incommensurable with some magnitude, then the remaining (magnitude) will also be incommensurable with it.

Let A and B be two commensurable magnitudes, and let one of them, A, be incommensurable with some other (magnitude), C.
I say that the remaining (magnitude), B, is also incommensurable with C.

For if B is commensurable with C, but A is also commensurable with B, A is thus also commensurable with C [Prop. 10.12].
But, (it is) also incommensurable (with C).
The very thing (is) impossible.
Thus, B is not commensurable with C.
Thus, (it is) incommensurable.

Thus, if two magnitudes are commensurable, and so on ....
