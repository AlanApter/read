To find a sixth binomial (straight-line).

Let the two numbers AC and CB be laid down such that AB does not have to each of them the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
And let D also be another number, which is not square, and does not have to each of BA and AC the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
And let some rational straight-line E be laid down.
And let it have been contrived that as D (is) to AB, so the (square) on E (is) to the (square) on FG [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on E (is) commensurable with the (square) on FG [Prop. 10.6].
And E is rational.
Thus, FG (is) also rational.
And since D does not have to AB the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on E thus does not have to the (square) on FG the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, E (is) incommensurable in length with FG [Prop. 10.9].
So, again, let it have be contrived that as BA (is) to AC, so the (square) on FG (is) to the (square) on GH [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
The (square) on FG (is) thus commensurable with the (square) on HG [Prop. 10.6].
The (square) on HG (is) thus rational.
Thus, HG (is) rational.
And since BA does not have to AC the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on FG does not have to the (square) on GH the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, FG is incommensurable in length with GH [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, FG and GH are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, FH is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].
So, we must show that (it is) also a sixth (binomial straight-line).

For since as D is to AB, so the (square) on E (is) to the (square) on FG, and also as BA is to AC, so the (square) on FG (is) to the (square) on GH, thus, via equality, as D is to AC, so the (square) on E (is) to the (square) on GH [Prop. 5.22].
And D does not have to AC the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on E does not have to the (square) on GH the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
E is thus incommensurable in length with GH [Prop. 10.9].
And (E) was also shown (to be) incommensurable (in length) with FG.
Thus, FG and GH are each incommensurable in length with E.
And since as BA is to AC, so the (square) on FG (is) to the (square) on GH, the (square) on FG (is) thus greater than the (square) on GH [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on GH and K be equal to the (square) on FG.
Thus, via conversion, as AB (is) to BC, so the (square) on FG (is) to the (square) on K [Prop. 5.19 corr.].
And AB does not have to BC the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Hence, the (square) on FG does not have to the (square) on K the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, FG is incommensurable in length with K [Prop. 10.9].
The square on FG is thus greater than (the square on) GH by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with (FG).
And FG and GH are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line) E (previously) laid down.

 Thus, FH is a sixth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.10].
 (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
