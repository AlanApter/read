A (straight-line) commensurable with a medial (straight-line) is medial.

Let {A magnitude} be a medial (straight-line), and let {B magnitude} be commensurable with {A magnitude}.
I say that {B magnitude} is also a medial (staight-line).

Let the rational (straight-line) {CD line} be set out, and let the rectangular area {CE polygon}, equal to the (square) on {A magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {ED line} as width.
{ED line} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].
And let the rectangular area {CF polygon}, equal to the (square) on {B magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {DF line} as width.
Therefore, since {A magnitude} is commensurable with {B magnitude}, the (square) on {A magnitude} is also commensurable with the (square) on {B magnitude}.
But, {EC polygon} is equal to the (square) on {A magnitude}, and {CF polygon} is equal to the (square) on {B magnitude}.
Thus, {EC polygon} is commensurable with {CF polygon}.
And as {EC polygon} is to {CF polygon}, so {ED line} (is) to {DF line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {ED line} is commensurable in length with {DF line} [Prop. 10.11].
And {ED line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line}.
{DF line} is thus also rational [Def. 10.3], and incommensurable in length with {DC line} [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, {CD line} and {DF line} are rational, and commensurable in square only.
And the square-root of a (rectangle contained) by rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, the square-root of the (rectangle contained) by {CD line} and {DF line} is medial.
And the square on {B magnitude} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {CD line} and {DF line}.
Thus, {B magnitude} is a medial (straight-line).

Corollary

And (it is) clear, from this, that an (area) commensurable with a medial area is medial.
