A (straight-line) commensurable with a medial (straight-line) is medial.

Let A be a medial (straight-line), and let B be commensurable with A.
I say that B is also a medial (staight-line).

Let the rational (straight-line) CD be set out, and let the rectangular area CE, equal to the (square) on A, have been applied to CD, producing ED as width.
ED is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with CD [Prop. 10.22].
And let the rectangular area CF, equal to the (square) on B, have been applied to CD, producing DF as width.
Therefore, since A is commensurable with B, the (square) on A is also commensurable with the (square) on B.
But, EC is equal to the (square) on A, and CF is equal to the (square) on B.
Thus, EC is commensurable with CF.
And as EC is to CF, so ED (is) to DF [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, ED is commensurable in length with DF [Prop. 10.11].
And ED is rational, and incommensurable in length with CD.
DF is thus also rational [Def. 10.3], and incommensurable in length with DC [Prop. 10.13].
Thus, CD and DF are rational, and commensurable in square only.
And the square-root of a (rectangle contained) by rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, the square-root of the (rectangle contained) by CD and DF is medial.
And the square on B is equal to the (rectangle contained) by CD and DF.
Thus, B is a medial (straight-line).

Corollary

And (it is) clear, from this, that an (area) commensurable with a medial area is medial.
