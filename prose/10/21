 The rectangle contained by rational straight-lines (which are) commensurable in square only is irrational, and its square-root is irrational---let it be called medial.

For let the rectangle AC be contained by the rational straight-lines AB and BC (which are) commensurable in square only.
I say that AC is irrational, and its square-root is irrational---let it be called medial.

For let the square AD have been described on AB.
AD is thus rational [Def. 10.4].
And since AB is incommensurable in length with BC.
For they were assumed to be commensurable in square only.
And AB (is) equal to BD.
DB is thus also incommensurable in length with BC.
And as DB is to BC, so AD (is) to AC [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, DA [is] incommensurable with AC [Prop. 10.11].
And DA (is) rational.
Thus, AC is irrational [Def. 10.4].
Hence, its square-root [that is to say, the square-root of the square equal to it] is also irrational [Def. 10.4]---let it be called medial.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
