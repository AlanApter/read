For two given unequal straight-lines, to find by (the square on) which (straight-line) the square on the greater (straight-line is) larger than (the square on) the lesser.

Let AB and C be the two given unequal straight-lines, and let AB be the greater of them.
So it is required to find by (the square on) which (straight-line) the square on AB (is) greater than (the square on) C.

Let the semi-circle ADB have been described on AB.
And let AD, equal to C, have been inserted into it [Prop. 4.1].
And let DB have been joined.
So (it is) clear that the angle ADB is a right-angle [Prop. 3.31], and that the square on AB (is) greater than (the square on) AD---that is to say, (the square on) C---by (the square on) DB [Prop. 1.47].

And, similarly, the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) two given straight-lines is also found likeso.

Let AD and DB be the two given straight-lines.
And let it be necessary to find the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) them.
For let them have been laid down such as to encompass a right-angle---(namely), that (angle encompassed) by AD and DB.
And let AB have been joined.
(It is) again clear that AB is the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) AD and DB [Prop. 1.47].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
