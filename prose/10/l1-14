For two given unequal straight-lines, to find by (the square on) which (straight-line) the square on the greater (straight-line is) larger than (the square on) the lesser.

Let {AB line} and {C magnitude} be the two given unequal straight-lines, and let {AB line} be the greater of them.
So it is required to find by (the square on) which (straight-line) the square on {AB line} (is) greater than (the square on) {C magnitude}.

Let the semi-circle {ADB arc O} have been described on {AB line}.
And let {AD line}, equal to {C magnitude}, have been inserted into it [Prop. 4.1].
And let {DB line} have been joined.
So (it is) clear that the angle {ADB angle} is a right-angle [Prop. 3.31], and that the square on {AB line} (is) greater than (the square on) {AD line}---that is to say, (the square on) {C magnitude}---by (the square on) {DB line} [Prop. 1.47].

And, similarly, the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) two given straight-lines is also found likeso.

Let {AD line} and {DB line} be the two given straight-lines.
And let it be necessary to find the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) them.
For let them have been laid down such as to encompass a right-angle---(namely), that (angle encompassed) by {AD line} and {DB line}.
And let {AB line} have been joined.
(It is) again clear that {AB line} is the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) {AD line} and {DB line} [Prop. 1.47].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
