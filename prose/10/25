The rectangle contained by medial straight-lines (which are) commensurable in square only is either rational or medial.

For let the rectangle {AC polygonl} be contained by the medial straight-lines {AB line} and {BC line} (which are) commensurable in square only.
I say that {AC polygonl} is either rational or medial.

For let the squares {AD polygonl} and {BE polygonl} have been described on (the straight-lines) {AB line} and {BC line} (respectively).
{AD polygonl} and {BE polygonl} are thus each medial.
And let the rational (straight-line) {FG line} be laid out.
And let the rectangular parallelogram {GH polygonl}, equal to {AD polygonl}, have been applied to {FG line}, producing {FH line} as breadth.
And let the rectangular parallelogram {MK polygonl}, equal to {AC polygonl}, have been applied to {HM line}, producing {HK line} as breadth.
And, finally, let {NL polygonl}, equal to {BE polygonl}, have similarly been applied to {KN line}, producing {KL line} as breadth.
Thus, {FH line}, {HK line}, and {KL line} are in a straight-line.
Therefore, since {AD polygonl} and {BE polygonl} are each medial, and {AD polygonl} is equal to {GH polygonl}, and {BE polygonl} to {NL polygonl}, {GH polygonl} and {NL polygonl} (are) thus each also medial.
And they are applied to the rational (straight-line) {FG line}.
{FH line} and {KL line} are thus each rational, and incommensurable in length with {FG line} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {AD polygonl} is commensurable with {BE polygonl}, {GH polygonl} is thus also commensurable with {NL polygonl}.
And as {GH polygonl} is to {NL polygonl}, so {FH line} (is) to {KL line} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {FH line} is commensurable in length with {KL line} [Prop. 10.11].
Thus, {FH line} and {KL line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in length.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {FH line} and {KL line} is rational [Prop. 10.19].
And since {DB line} is equal to {BA line}, and {OB line} to {BC line}, thus as {DB line} is to {BC line}, so {AB line} (is) to {BO line}.
But, as {DB line} (is) to {BC line}, so {DA polygonl} (is) to {AC polygonl} [Props. 6.1].
And as {AB line} (is) to {BO line}, so {AC polygonl} (is) to {CO polygonl} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, as {DA polygonl} is to {AC polygonl}, so {AC polygonl} (is) to {CO polygonl}.
And {AD polygonl} is equal to {GH polygonl}, and {AC polygonl} to {MK polygonl}, and {CO polygonl}  to {NL polygonl}.
Thus, as {GH polygonl} is to {MK polygonl}, so {MK polygonl} (is) to {NL polygonl}.
Thus, also, as {FH line} is to {HK line}, so {HK line} (is) to {KL line} [Props. 6.1, 5.11].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {FH line} and {KL line} is equal to the (square) on {HK line} [Prop. 6.17].
And the (rectangle contained) by {FH line} and {KL line} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {HK line} is also rational.
Thus, {HK line} is rational.
And if it is commensurable in length with {FG line} then {HN polygonl} is rational [Prop. 10.19].
And if it is incommensurable in length with {FG line} then {KH line} and {HM line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only: thus, {HN polygonl} is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, {HN polygonl} is either rational or medial.
And {HN polygonl} (is) equal to {AC polygonl}.
Thus, {AC polygonl} is either rational or medial.

Thus, the ... by medial straight-lines (which are) commensurable in square only, and so on ....
