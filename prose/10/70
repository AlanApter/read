A (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) is (itself also) the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

Let AB be the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas), and (let) CD (be) commensurable (in length) with AB.
We must show that CD is also the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).

For since AB is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas), let it have been divided into its (component) straight-lines at E.
Thus, AE and EB are incommensurable in square, making the sum of the [squares] on them medial, and the (rectangle contained) by them medial, and, moreover, the sum of the (squares) on AE and EB incommensurable with the (rectangle) contained by AE and EB [Prop. 10.41].
And let the same construction have been made as in the previous (propositions).
So, similarly, we can show that CF and FD are also incommensurable in square, and (that) the sum of the (squares) on AE and EB (is) commensurable with the sum of the (squares) on CF and FD, and the (rectangle contained) by AE and EB with the (rectangle contained) by CF and FD.
Hence, the sum of the squares on CF and FD is also medial, and the (rectangle contained) by CF and FD (is) medial, and, moreover, the sum of the squares on CF and FD (is) incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by CF and FD.

Thus, CD is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) [Prop. 10.41].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
