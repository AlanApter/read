If two magnitudes do not have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number then the magnitudes will be incommensurable.

For let the two magnitudes A and B not have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.
I say that the magnitudes A and B are incommensurable.

For if they are commensurable, A will have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5].
But it does not have (such a ratio).
Thus, the magnitudes A and B are incommensurable.

Thus, if two magnitudes ... to one another, and so on ....
