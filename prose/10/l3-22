If there are two straight-lines then as the first is to the second, so the (square) on the first (is) to the (rectangle contained) by the two straight-lines.

Let {FE line} and {EG line} be two straight-lines.
I say that as {FE line} is to {EG line}, so the (square) on {FE line} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {FE line} and {EG line}.

For let the square {DF polygonl} have been described on {FE line}.
And let {GD polygonl} have been completed.
Therefore, since as {FE line} is to {EG line}, so {FD polygonl} (is) to {DG polygonl} [Prop. 6.1], and {FD polygonl} is the (square) on {FE line}, and {DG polygonl} the (rectangle contained) by {DE line} and {EG line}---that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by {FE line} and {EG line}---thus as {FE line} is to {EG line}, so the (square) on {FE line} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {FE line} and {EG line}.
And also, similarly, as the (rectangle contained) by {GE line} and {EF line} is to the (square on) {EF line}---that is to say, as {GD polygonl} (is) to {FD polygonl}---so {GE line} (is) to {EF line}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
