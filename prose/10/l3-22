If there are two straight-lines then as the first is to the second, so the (square) on the first (is) to the (rectangle contained) by the two straight-lines.

Let FE and EG be two straight-lines.
I say that as FE is to EG, so the (square) on FE (is) to the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG.

For let the square DF have been described on FE.
And let GD have been completed.
Therefore, since as FE is to EG, so FD (is) to DG [Prop. 6.1], and FD is the (square) on FE, and DG the (rectangle contained) by DE and EG---that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG---thus as FE is to EG, so the (square) on FE (is) to the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG.
And also, similarly, as the (rectangle contained) by GE and EF is to the (square on) EF---that is to say, as GD (is) to FD---so GE (is) to EF.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
