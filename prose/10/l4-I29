To find two square numbers such that the sum of them is also square.

Let the two numbers AB and BC be laid down.
And let them be either (both) even or (both) odd.
And since, if an even (number) is subtracted from an even (number), or if an odd (number is subtracted) from an odd (number), then the remainder is even [Props. 9.24, 9.26], the remainder AC is thus even.
Let AC have been cut in half at D.
And let AB and BC also be either similar plane (numbers), or square (numbers)---which are themselves also similar plane (numbers).
Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the square on CD, is equal to the square on BD [Prop. 2.6].
And the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC is square---inasmuch as it was shown that if two similar plane (numbers) make some (number) by multiplying one another then the (number so) created is square [Prop. 9.1].
Thus, two square numbers have been found---(namely,) the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, and the (square) on CD---which, (when) added (together), make the square on BD.

And (it is) clear that two square (numbers) have again been found---(namely,) the (square) on BD, and the (square) on CD---such that their difference---(namely,) the (rectangle) contained by AB and BC---is square whenever AB and BC are similar plane (numbers).
But, when they are not similar plane numbers, two square (numbers) have been found---(namely,) the (square) on BD, and the (square) on DC---between which the difference---(namely,) the (rectangle) contained by AB and BC---is not square.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
