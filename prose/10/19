The rectangle contained by rational straight-lines (which are) commensurable in length is rational.

For let the rectangle {AC polygon} have been enclosed by the rational straight-lines {AB line} and {BC line} (which are) commensurable in length.
I say that {AC polygon} is rational.

For let the square {AD polygon} have been described on {AB line}.
{AD polygon} is thus rational [Def. 10.4].
And since {AB line} is commensurable in length with {BC line}, and {AB line} is equal to {BD line}, {BD line} is thus commensurable in length with {BC line}.
And as {BD line} is to {BC line}, so {DA polygon} (is) to {AC polygon} [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, {DA polygon} is commensurable with {AC polygon} [Prop. 10.11].
And {DA polygon} (is) rational.
Thus, {AC polygon} is also rational [Def. 10.4].
Thus, the ... by rational straight-lines ... commensurable, and so on ....
