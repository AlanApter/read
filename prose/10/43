A first bimedial (straight-line) can be divided (into its component terms) at one point only

Let AB be a first bimedial (straight-line) which has been divided at C, such that AC and CB are medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a rational (area) [Prop. 10.37].
I say that AB cannot be (so) divided at another point.

For, if possible, let it also have been divided at D, such that AD and DB are also medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a rational (area).
Since, therefore, by whatever (amount) twice the (rectangle contained) by AD and DB differs from twice the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB, (the sum of) the (squares) on AC and CB differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on AD and DB by this (same amount) [Prop. 10.41 lem.].
And twice the (rectangle contained) by AD and DB differs from twice the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB by a rational (area).
For (they are) both rational (areas).
(The sum of) the (squares) on AC and CB thus differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on AD and DB by a rational (area, despite both) being medial (areas).
The very thing is absurd [Prop. 10.26].

Thus, a first bimedial (straight-line) cannot be divided into its (component) terms at different points.
Thus, (it can be so divided) at one point only.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
