A medial (area) does not exceed a medial (area) by a rational (area).

For, if possible, let the medial (area) {AB} exceed the medial (area) {AC} by the rational (area) {DB}.
And let the rational (straight-line) {EF} be laid down.
And let the rectangular parallelogram {FH}, equal to {AB}, have been applied to to {EF}, producing {EH} as breadth.
And let {FG}, equal to {AC}, have been cut off (from {FH}).
Thus, the remainder {BD} is equal to the remainder {KH}.
And {DB} is rational.
Thus, {KH} is also rational.
Therefore, since {AB} and {AC} are each medial, and {AB} is equal to {FH}, and {AC} to {FG}, {FH} and {FG} are thus each also medial.

And they are applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}.
Thus, {HE} and {EG} are each rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.22].
And since {DB} is rational, and is equal to {KH}, {KH} is thus also rational.
And ({KH}) is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF}.
{GH} is thus rational, and commensurable in length with {EF} [Prop. 10.20].
But, {EG} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF}.
Thus, {EG} is incommensurable in length with {GH} [Prop. 10.13].
And as {EG} is to {GH}, so the (square) on {EG} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {EG} and {GH} [Prop. 10.13 lem.].
Thus, the (square) on {EG} is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {EG} and {GH} [Prop. 10.11].
But, the (sum of the) squares on {EG} and {GH} is commensurable with the (square) on {EG}.
For ({EG} and {GH} are) both rational.
And twice the (rectangle contained) by {EG} and {GH} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {EG} and {GH} [Prop. 10.6].
For (the former) is double the latter.
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on {EG} and {GH} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {EG} and {GH} [Prop. 10.13].
And thus the sum of the (squares) on {EG} and {GH} plus twice the (rectangle contained) by {EG} and {GH}, that is the (square) on {EH} [Prop. 2.4], is incommensurable with the (sum of the squares) on {EG} and {GH} [Prop. 10.16].
And the (sum of the squares) on {EG} and {GH} (is) rational.
Thus, the (square) on {EH} is irrational [Def. 10.4].
Thus, {EH} is irrational [Def. 10.4].
But, (it is) also rational.
The very thing is impossible.

Thus, a medial (area) does not exceed a medial (area) by a rational (area).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
