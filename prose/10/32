To find two medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area), such that the square on the greater is larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the greater.

Let three rational (straight-lines), A, B and C, commensurable in square only, be laid out such that the square on A is greater than (the square on C) by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (A) [Prop. 10.29].
And let the (square) on D be equal to the (rectangle contained) by A and B.
Thus, the (square) on D (is) medial.
Thus, D is also medial [Prop. 10.21].
And let the (rectangle contained) by D and E be equal to the (rectangle contained) by B and C.
And since as the (rectangle contained) by A and B is to the (rectangle contained) by B and C, so A (is) to C [Prop. 10.21 lem.], but the (square) on D is equal to the (rectangle contained) by A and B, and the (rectangle contained) by D and E to the (rectangle contained) by B and C, thus as A is to C, so the (square) on D (is) to the (rectangle contained) by D and E.
And as the (square) on D (is) to the (rectangle contained) by D and E, so D (is) to E [Prop. 10.21 lem.].
And thus as A (is) to C, so D (is) to E.
And A (is) commensurable in square [only] with C.
Thus, D (is) also commensurable in square only with E [Prop. 10.11].
And D (is) medial.
Thus, E (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23].
And since as A is to C, (so) D (is) to E, and the square on A is greater than (the square on) C by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (A), the square on D will thus also be greater than (the square on) E by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (D) [Prop. 10.14].
So, I also say that the (rectangle contained) by D and E is medial.
For since the (rectangle contained) by B and C is equal to the (rectangle contained) by D and E, and the (rectangle contained) by B and C (is) medial [for B and C are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only] [Prop. 10.21], the (rectangle contained) by D and E (is) thus also medial.

Thus, two medial (straight-lines), D and E, commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area), have been found such that the square on the greater is larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the greater.

So, similarly, (the proposition) can again also be demonstrated for (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length with the greater), provided that the square on A is greater than (the square on) C by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (A) [Prop. 10.30].
