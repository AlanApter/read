If two commensurable magnitudes are added together then the whole will also be commensurable with each of them.
And if the whole is commensurable with one of them then the original magnitudes will also be commensurable (with one another).

For let the two commensurable magnitudes AB and BC be laid down together.
I say that the whole AC is also commensurable with each of AB and BC.

For since AB and BC are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D.
Therefore, since D measures (both) AB and BC, it will also measure the whole AC.
And it also measures AB and BC.
Thus, D measures AB, BC, and AC.
Thus, AC is commensurable with each of AB and BC [Def. 10.1].

And so let AC be commensurable with AB.
I say that AB and BC are also commensurable.

For since AC and AB are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D.
Therefore, since D measures (both) CA and AB, it will thus also measure the remainder BC.
And it also measures AB.
Thus, D will measure (both) AB and BC.
Thus, AB and BC are commensurable [Def. 10.1].

Thus, if two magnitudes, and so on ....
