(Magnitudes) commensurable with the same magnitude are also commensurable with one another.

For let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} each be commensurable with {C magnitude}.
I say that {A magnitude} is also commensurable with {B magnitude}.

For since {A magnitude} is commensurable with {C magnitude}, {A magnitude} thus has to {C magnitude} the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5].
Let it have (the ratio) which {D magnitude} (has) to {E magnitude}.
Again, since {C magnitude} is commensurable with {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} thus has to {B magnitude} the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5].
Let it have (the ratio) which {F magnitude} (has) to {G magnitude}.
And for any multitude whatsoever of given ratios---(namely,) those which {D magnitude} has to {E magnitude}, and {F magnitude} to {G magnitude}---let the numbers {H magnitude}, {K magnitude}, {L magnitude} (which are) continuously (proportional) in the(se) given ratios have been taken [Prop. 8.4].
Hence, as {D magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude}, and as {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, so {K magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}.

Therefore, since as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, but as {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude}, thus also as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].
Again, since as {C magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, but as {F magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}, [so] {K magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude}, thus also as {C magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {K magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].
And also as {A magnitude} is to {C magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {K magnitude}.
Thus, via equality, as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude} [Prop. 5.22].
Thus, {A magnitude} has to {B magnitude} the ratio which the number {H magnitude} (has) to the number {L magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} is commensurable with {B magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].

Thus, (magnitudes) commensurable with the same magnitude are also commensurable with one another.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
