A rectangle contained by medial straight-lines (which are) commensurable in length is medial.

For let the rectangle AC be contained by the medial straight-lines AB and BC (which are) commensurable in length.
I say that AC is medial.

For let the square AD have been described on AB.
AD is thus medial [see previous footnote].
And since AB is commensurable in length with BC, and AB (is) equal to BD, DB is thus also commensurable in length with BC.
Hence, DA is also commensurable with AC [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
And DA (is) medial.
Thus, AC (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
