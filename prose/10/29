To find two rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, such that the square on the greater is larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) commensurable in length with the greater.

For let some rational (straight-line) {AB} be laid down, and two square numbers, {CD} and {DE}, such that the difference between them, {CE}, is not square [Prop. 10.28 lem. I].
And let the semi-circle {AFB} have been drawn on {AB}.
And let it be contrived that as {DC} (is) to {CE}, so the square on {BA} (is) to the square on {AF} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
And let {FB} have been joined.

[Therefore,] since as the (square) on {BA} is to the (square) on {AF}, so {DC} (is) to {CE}, the (square) on {BA} thus has to the (square) on {AF} the ratio which the number {DC} (has) to the number {CE}.
Thus, the (square) on {BA} is commensurable with the (square) on {AF} [Prop. 10.6].
And the (square) on {AB} (is) rational [Def. 10.4].
Thus, the (square) on {AF} (is) also rational.
Thus, {AF} (is) also rational.
And since {DC} does not have to {CE} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {BA} thus does not have to the (square) on {AF} the ratio which (some) square number has to (some) square number either.
Thus, {AB} is incommensurable in length with {AF} [Prop. 10.9].
Thus, the rational (straight-lines) {BA} and {AF} are commensurable in square only.
And since as {DC} [is] to {CE}, so the (square) on {BA} (is) to the (square) on {AF}, thus, via conversion, as {CD} (is) to {DE}, so the (square) on {AB} (is) to the (square) on {BF} [Props. 5.19 corr., 3.31, 1.47].
And {CD} has to {DE} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
Thus, the (square) on {AB} also has to the (square) on {BF} the ratio which (some) square number has to (some) square number.
{AB} is thus commensurable in length with {BF} [Prop. 10.9].
And the (square) on {AB} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AF} and {FB} [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the square on {AB} is greater than (the square on) {AF} by (the square on) {BF}, (which is) commensurable (in length) with ({AB}).

Thus, two rational (straight-lines), {BA} and {AF}, commensurable in square only, have been found such that the square on the greater, {AB}, is larger than (the square on) the lesser, {AF}, by the (square) on {BF}, (which is) commensurable in length with ({AB}).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
