A medial (area), incommensurable with the whole, being subtracted from a medial (area), the two remaining irrational (straight-lines) arise (as) the (square-root of the area)---either a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), or that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.

For, as in the previous figures, let the medial (area) BD, incommensurable with the whole, have been subtracted from the medial (area) BC.
I say that the square-root of EC is one of two irrational (straight-lines)---either a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), or that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.

For since BC and BD are each medial (areas), and BC (is) incommensurable with BD, accordingly, FH and FK will each be rational (straight-lines), and incommensurable in length with FG [Prop. 10.22].
And since BC is incommensurable with BD---that is to say, GH with GK---HF (is) also incommensurable (in length) with FK [Props. 6.1, 10.11].
Thus, FH and FK are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
KH is thus as apotome [Prop. 10.73], [and FK an attachment (to it).
So, the square on FH is greater than (the square on) FK either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable, or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable, (in length) with(FH).]

So, if the square on FH is greater than (the square on) FK by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (FH), and (since) neither of FH and FK is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) FG, KH is a third apotome [Def. 10.3].
And KL (is) rational.
And the rectangle contained by a rational (straight-line) and a third apotome is irrational, and the square-root of it is that irrational (straight-line) called a second apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.93].
Hence, the square-root of LH---that is to say, (of) EC---is a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).

And if the square on FH is greater than (the square on) FK by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable [in length] with (FH), and (since) neither of HF and FK is commensurable in length with FG, KH is a sixth apotome [Def. 10.16].
And the square-root of the (rectangle contained) by a rational (straight-line) and a sixth apotome is that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole [Prop. 10.96].
Thus, the square-root of LH---that is to say, (of) EC---is that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) makes a medial whole.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
