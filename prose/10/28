To find (two) medial (straight-lines), containing a medial (area), (which are) commensurable in square only.

Let the [three] rational (straight-lines) {A}, {B}, and {C}, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid down.
And let, {D}, the mean proportional (straight-line) to {A} and {B}, have been taken [Prop. 6.13].
And let it be contrived that as {B} (is) to {C}, (so) {D} (is) to {E} [Prop. 6.12].

Since the rational (straight-lines) {A} and {B} are commensurable in square only, the (rectangle contained) by {A} and {B}---that is to say, the (square) on {D} [Prop. 6.17]---is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, {D} (is) medial [Prop. 10.21].
And since {B} and {C} are commensurable in square only, and as {B} is to {C}, (so) {D} (is) to {E}, {D} and {E} are thus commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].
And {D} (is) medial.
{E} (is) thus also medial [Prop. 10.23].
Thus, {D} and {E} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
So, I say that they also enclose a medial (area).
For since as {B} is to {C}, (so) {D} (is) to {E}, thus, alternately, as {B} (is) to {D}, (so) {C} (is) to {E} [Prop. 5.16].
And as {B} (is) to {D}, (so) {D} (is) to {A}.
And thus as {D} (is) to {A}, (so) {C} (is) to {E}.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {A} and {C} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {D} and {E} [Prop. 6.16].
And the (rectangle contained) by {A} and {C} is medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {D} and {E} (is) also medial.

Thus, (two) medial (straight-lines, {D} and {E}), containing a medial (area), (which are) commensurable in square only, have been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
