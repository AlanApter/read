If two incommensurable magnitudes are added together then the whole will also be incommensurable with each of them.
And if the whole is incommensurable with one of them then the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable (with one another).

For let the two incommensurable magnitudes AB and BC be laid down together.
I say that that the whole AC is also incommensurable with each of AB and BC.

For if CA and AB are not incommensurable then some magnitude will measure [them].
If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D.
Therefore, since D measures (both) CA and AB, it will thus also measure the remainder BC.
And it also measures AB.
Thus, D measures (both) AB and BC.
Thus, AB and BC are commensurable [Def. 10.1].
But they were also assumed (to be) incommensurable.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) CA and AB.
Thus, CA and AB are incommensurable [Def. 10.1].
So, similarly, we can show that AC and CB are also incommensurable.
Thus, AC is incommensurable with each of AB and BC.

And so let AC be incommensurable with one of AB and BC.
So let it, first of all, be incommensurable with AB.
I say that AB and BC are also incommensurable.
For if they are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them.
Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D.
Therefore, since D measures (both) AB and BC, it will thus also measure the whole AC.
And it also measures AB.
Thus, D measures (both) CA and AB.
Thus, CA and AB are commensurable [Def. 10.1].
But they were also assumed (to be) incommensurable.
The very thing is impossible.
Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) AB and BC.
Thus, AB and BC are incommensurable [Def. 10.1].

Thus, if two...magnitudes, and so on ....
