Incommensurable magnitudes do not have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.

Let A and B be incommensurable magnitudes.
I say that A does not have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.

For if A has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number then A will be commensurable with B [Prop. 10.6].
But it is not.
Thus, A does not have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.

Thus, incommensurable numbers do not have to one another, and so on ....
