If a parallelogram, falling short by a square figure, is applied to some straight-line then the applied (parallelogram) is equal (in area) to the (rectangle contained) by the pieces of the straight-line created via the application (of the parallelogram).

For let the parallelogram {ACDE polygon}, falling short by the square figure {DCBF polygon}, have been applied to the straight-line {AB line}.
I say that {ACDE polygon} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CB line}.

And it is immediately obvious.
For since {DCBF polygon} is a square, {DC line} is equal to {CB line}.
And {ACDE polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {AC line} and {CD line}---that is to say, by {AC line} and {CB line}.

Thus, if ...to some straight-line, and so on ....
