If a parallelogram, falling short by a square figure, is applied to some straight-line then the applied (parallelogram) is equal (in area) to the (rectangle contained) by the pieces of the straight-line created via the application (of the parallelogram).

For let the parallelogram AD, falling short by the square figure DB, have been applied to the straight-line AB.
I say that AD is equal to the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB.

And it is immediately obvious.
For since DB is a square, DC is equal to CB.
And AD is the (rectangle contained) by AC and CD---that is to say, by AC and CB.

Thus, if ...to some straight-line, and so on ....
