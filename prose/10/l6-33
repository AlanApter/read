Let ABC be a right-angled triangle having the (angle) A a right-angle.
And let the perpendicular AD have been drawn.
I say that the (rectangle contained) by CBD is equal to the (square) on BA, and the (rectangle contained) by BCD (is) equal to the (square) on CA, and the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC (is) equal to the (square) on AD, and, further, the (rectangle contained) by BC and AD [is] equal to the (rectangle contained) by BA and AC.

And, first of all, (let us prove) that the (rectangle contained) by CBD [is] equal to the (square) on BA.

For since AD has been drawn from the right-angle in a right-angled triangle, perpendicular to the base, ABD and ADC are thus triangles (which are) similar to the whole, ABC, and to one another [Prop. 6.8].
And since triangle ABC is similar to triangle ABD, thus as CB is to BA, so BA (is) to BD [Prop. 6.4].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by CBD is equal to the (square) on AB [Prop. 6.17].

So, for the same (reasons), the (rectangle contained) by BCD is also equal to the (square) on AC.

And since if a (straight-line) is drawn from the rightangle in a right-angled triangle, perpendicular to the base, the (straight-line so) drawn is the mean proportional to the pieces of the base [Prop. 6.8 corr.], thus as BD is to DA, so AD (is) to DC.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC is equal to the (square) on DA [Prop. 6.17].

I also say that the (rectangle contained) by BC and AD is equal to the (rectangle contained) by BA and AC.
For since, as we said, ABC is similar to ABD, thus as BC is to CA, so BA (is) to AD [Prop. 6.4].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by BC and AD is equal to the (rectangle contained) by BA and AC [Prop. 6.16].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
