To find two straight-lines incommensurable with a given straight-line, the one (incommensurable) in length only, the other also (incommensurable) in square.

Let A be the given straight-line.
So it is required to find two straight-lines incommensurable with A, the one (incommensurable) in length only, the other also (incommensurable) in square.

For let two numbers, B and C, not having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number---that is to say, not (being) similar plane (numbers)---have been taken.
And let it be contrived that as B (is) to C, so the square on A (is) to the square on D.
For we learned (how to do this) [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on A (is) commensurable with the (square) on D [Prop. 10.6].
And since B does not have to C the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on A thus does not have to the (square) on D the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, A is incommensurable in length with D [Prop. 10.9].
Let the (straight-line) E (which is) in mean proportion to A and D have been taken [Prop. 6.13].
Thus, as A is to D, so the square on A (is) to the (square) on E [Def. 5.9].
And A is incommensurable in length with D.
Thus, the square on A is also incommensurble with the square on E [Prop. 10.11].
Thus, A is incommensurable in square with E.

Thus, two straight-lines, D and E, (which are) incommensurable with the given straight-line A, have been found, the one, D, (incommensurable) in length only, the other, E, (incommensurable) in square, and, clearly, also in length.
[(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.]
