To find two straight-lines incommensurable with a given straight-line, the one (incommensurable) in length only, the other also (incommensurable) in square.

Let {A magnitude} be the given straight-line.
So it is required to find two straight-lines incommensurable with {A magnitude}, the one (incommensurable) in length only, the other also (incommensurable) in square.

For let two numbers, {B magnitude} and {C magnitude}, not having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number---that is to say, not (being) similar plane (numbers)---have been taken.
And let it be contrived that as {B magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so the square on {A magnitude} (is) to the square on {D magnitude}.
For we learned (how to do this) [Prop. 10.6 corr.].
Thus, the (square) on {A magnitude} (is) commensurable with the (square) on {D magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].
And since {B magnitude} does not have to {C magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {A magnitude} thus does not have to the (square) on {D magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.
Thus, {A magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {D magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].
Let the (straight-line) {E magnitude} (which is) in mean proportion to {A magnitude} and {D magnitude} have been taken [Prop. 6.13].
Thus, as {A magnitude} is to {D magnitude}, so the square on {A magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {E magnitude} [Def. 5.9].
And {A magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {D magnitude}.
Thus, the square on {A magnitude} is also incommensurble with the square on {E magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].
Thus, {A magnitude} is incommensurable in square with {E magnitude}.

Thus, two straight-lines, {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}, (which are) incommensurable with the given straight-line {A magnitude}, have been found, the one, {D magnitude}, (incommensurable) in length only, the other, {E magnitude}, (incommensurable) in square, and, clearly, also in length.
[(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.]
