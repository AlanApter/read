A (straight-line) commensurable in length with an apotome is an apotome, and (is) the same in order.

Let AB be an apotome, and let CD be commensurable in length with AB.
I say that CD is also an apotome, and (is) the same in order as AB.

For since AB is an apotome, let BE be an attachment to it.
Thus, AE and EB are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
And let it have been contrived that the (ratio) of BE to DF is the same as the ratio of AB to CD [Prop. 6.12].
Thus, also, as one is to one, (so) all [are] to all [Prop. 5.12].
And thus as the whole AE is to the whole CF, so AB (is) to CD.
And AB (is) commensurable in length with CD.
AE (is) thus also commensurable (in length) with CF, and BE with DF [Prop. 10.11].
And AE and BE are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, CF and FD are also rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.13].
[CD is thus an apotome.
So, I say that (it is) also the same in order as AB.]

Therefore, since as AE is to CF, so BE (is) to DF, thus, alternately, as AE is to EB, so CF (is) to FD [Prop. 5.16].
So, the square on AE is greater than (the square on) EB either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable, or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable, (in length) with (AE).
Therefore, if the (square) on AE is greater than (the square on) EB by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (AE) then the square on CF will also be greater than (the square on) FD by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (CF) [Prop. 10.14].
And if AE is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) then so (is) CF [Prop. 10.12], and if BE (is commensurable), so (is) DF, and if neither of AE or EB (are commensurable), neither (are) either of CF or FD [Prop. 10.13].
And if the (square) on AE is greater [than (the square on) EB] by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (AE) then the (square) on CF will also be greater than (the square on) FD by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (CF) [Prop. 10.14].
And if AE is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), so (is) CF [Prop. 10.12], and if BE (is commensurable), so (is) DF, and if neither of AE or EB (are commensurable), neither (are) either of CF or FD [Prop. 10.13].

Thus, CD is an apotome, and (is) the same in order as AB [Defs. 10.11-10.16].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
