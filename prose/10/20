If a rational (area) is applied to a rational (straightline) then it produces as breadth a (straight-line which is) rational, and commensurable in length with the (straightline) to which it is applied.

For let the rational (area) AC have been applied to the rational (straight-line) AB, producing the (straight-line) BC as breadth.
I say that BC is rational, and commensurable in length with BA.

For let the square AD have been described on AB.
AD is thus rational [Def. 10.4].
And AC (is) also rational.
DA is thus commensurable with AC.
And as DA is to AC, so DB (is) to BC [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, DB is also commensurable (in length) with BC [Prop. 10.11].
And DB (is) equal to BA.
Thus, AB (is) also commensurable (in length) with BC.
And AB is rational.
Thus, BC is also rational, and commensurable in length with AB [Def. 10.3].

Thus, if a rational (area) is applied to a rational (straight-line), and so on ....
