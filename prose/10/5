Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.

Let A and B be commensurable magnitudes.
I say that A has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.

For if A and B are commensurable (magnitudes) then some magnitude will measure them.
Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be C.
And as many times as C measures A, so many units let there be in D.
And as many times as C measures B, so many units let there be in E.

Therefore, since C measures A according to the units in D, and a unit also measures D according to the units in it, a unit thus measures the number D as many times as the magnitude C (measures) A.
Thus, as C is to A, so a unit (is) to D [Def. 7.20].
Thus, inversely, as A (is) to C, so D (is) to a unit [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
Again, since C measures B according to the units in E, and a unit also measures E according to the units in it, a unit thus measures E the same number of times that C (measures) B.
Thus, as C is to B, so a unit (is) to E [Def. 7.20].
And it was also shown that as A (is) to C, so D (is) to a unit.
Thus, via equality, as A is to B, so the number D (is) to the (number) E [Prop. 5.22].

Thus, the commensurable magnitudes A and B have to one another the ratio which the number D (has) to the number E.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
