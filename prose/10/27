To find (two) medial (straight-lines), containing a rational (area), (which are) commensurable in square only.

Let the two rational (straight-lines) {A} and {B}, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid down.
And let {C}---the mean proportional (straight-line) to {A} and {B}---have been taken [Prop. 6.13].
And let it be contrived that as {A} (is) to {B}, so {C} (is) to {D} [Prop. 6.12].

And since the rational (straight-lines) {A} and {B} are commensurable in square only, the (rectangle contained) by {A} and {B}---that is to say, the (square) on {C} [Prop. 6.17]---is thus medial [Prop. 10.21].
Thus, {C} is medial [Prop. 10.21].
And since as {A} is to {B}, [so] {C} (is) to {D}, and {A} and {B} [are] commensurable in square only, {C} and {D} are thus also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].
And {C} is medial.
Thus, {D} is also medial [Prop. 10.23].
Thus, {C} and {D} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
I say that they also contain a rational (area).
For since as {A} is to {B}, so {C} (is) to {D}, thus, alternately, as {A} is to {C}, so {B} (is) to {D} [Prop. 5.16].
But, as {A} (is) to {C}, (so) {C} (is) to {B}.
And thus as {C} (is) to {B}, so {B} (is) to {D} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {C} and {D} is equal to the (square) on {B} [Prop. 6.17].
And the (square) on {B} (is) rational.
Thus, the (rectangle contained) by {C} and {D} [is] also rational.

Thus, (two) medial (straight-lines, {C} and {D}), containing a rational (area), (which are) commensurable in square only, have been found.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
