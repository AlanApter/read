If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number then the magnitudes will be commensurable.

For let the two magnitudes {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} have to one another the ratio which the number {D magnitude} (has) to the number {E magnitude}.
I say that the magnitudes {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are commensurable.

For, as many units as there are in {D magnitude}, let {A magnitude} have been divided into so many equal (divisions).
And let {C magnitude} be equal to one of them.
And as many units as there are in {E magnitude}, let {F magnitude} be the sum of so many magnitudes equal to {C magnitude}.
Therefore, since as many units as there are in {D magnitude}, so many magnitudes equal to {C magnitude} are also in {A magnitude}, therefore whichever part a unit is of {D magnitude}, {C magnitude} is also the same part of {A magnitude}.
Thus, as {C magnitude} is to {A magnitude}, so a unit (is) to {D magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
And a unit measures the number {D magnitude}.
Thus, {C magnitude} also measures {A magnitude}.
And since as {C magnitude} is to {A magnitude}, so a unit (is) to the [number] {D magnitude}, thus, inversely, as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so the number {D magnitude} (is) to a unit [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
Again, since as many units as there are in {E magnitude}, so many (magnitudes) equal to {C magnitude} are also in {F magnitude}, thus as {C magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so a unit (is) to the [number] {E magnitude} [Def. 7.20].
And it was also shown that as {A magnitude} (is) to {C magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to a unit.
Thus, via equality, as {A magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 5.22].
But, as {D magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}.
And thus as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so (it) also is to {F magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].
Thus, {A magnitude} has the same ratio to each of {B magnitude} and {F magnitude}.
Thus, {B magnitude} is equal to {F magnitude} [Prop. 5.9].
And {C magnitude} measures {F magnitude}.
Thus, it also measures {B magnitude}.
But, in fact, (it) also (measures) {A magnitude}.
Thus, {C magnitude} measures (both) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.
Thus, {A magnitude} is commensurable with {B magnitude} [Def. 10.1].

Thus, if two magnitudes ... to one another, and so on ....

Corollary

So it is clear, from this, that if there are two numbers, like {D magnitude} and {E magnitude}, and a straight-line, like {A magnitude}, then it is possible to contrive that as the number {D magnitude} (is) to the number {E magnitude}, so the straight-line (is) to (another) straight-line (i.e., {F magnitude}).
And if the mean proportion, (say) {B magnitude}, is taken of {A magnitude} and {F magnitude},then as {A magnitude} is to {F magnitude}, so the (square) on {A magnitude} (will be) to the (square) on {B magnitude}.
That is to say, as the first (is) to the third, so the (figure) on the first (is) to the similar, and similarly described, (figure) on the second [Prop. 6.19 corr.].
But, as {A magnitude} (is) to {F magnitude}, so the number {D magnitude} is to the number {E magnitude}.
Thus, it has also been contrived that as the number {D magnitude} (is) to the number {E magnitude}, so the (figure) on the straight-line {A magnitude} (is) to the (similar figure) on the straight-line {B magnitude}.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
