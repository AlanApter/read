For unequal magnitudes, the greater (magnitude) has a greater ratio than the lesser to the same (magnitude).
And the latter (magnitude) has a greater ratio to the lesser (magnitude) than to the greater.

Let {AB magnitude} and {C magnitude} be unequal magnitudes, and let {AB magnitude} be the greater (of the two), and {D magnitude} another random magnitude.
I say that {AB magnitude} has a greater ratio to {D magnitude} than {C magnitude} (has) to {D magnitude}, and (that) {D magnitude} has a greater ratio to {C magnitude} than (it has) to {AB magnitude}.

For since {AB magnitude} is greater than {C magnitude}, let {BE magnitude} be made equal to {C magnitude}.
So, the lesser of {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude}, being multiplied, will sometimes be greater than {D magnitude} [Def. 5.4].
{figure 1}First of all, let {AE magnitude} be less than {EB magnitude}, and let {AE magnitude} have been multiplied, and let {FG magnitude} be a multiple of it which (is) greater than {D magnitude}.
And as many times as {FG magnitude} is (divisible) by {AE magnitude}, so many times let {GH magnitude} also have become (divisible) by {EB magnitude}, and {K magnitude} by {C magnitude}.
And let the double multiple {L magnitude} of {D magnitude} have been taken, and the triple multiple {M magnitude}, and several more, (each increasing) in order by one, until the (multiple) taken becomes the first multiple of {D magnitude} (which is) greater than {K magnitude}.
Let it have been taken, and let it also be the quadruple multiple {N magnitude} of {D magnitude}---the first (multiple) greater than {K magnitude}.

Therefore, since {K magnitude} is less than {N magnitude} first, {K magnitude} is thus not less than {M magnitude}.
And since {FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} are equal multiples of {AE magnitude} and {EB magnitude} (respectively), {FG magnitude} and {FH magnitude} are thus equal multiples of {AE magnitude} and {AB magnitude} (respectively) [Prop. 5.1].
And {FG magnitude} and {K magnitude} are equal multiples of {AE magnitude} and {C magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, {FH magnitude} and {K magnitude} are equal multiples of {AB magnitude} and {C magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, {FH magnitude}, {K magnitude} are equal multiples of {AB magnitude}, {C magnitude}.
Again, since {GH magnitude} and {K magnitude} are equal multiples of {EB magnitude} and {C magnitude}, and {EB magnitude} (is) equal to {C magnitude}, {GH magnitude} (is) thus also equal to {K magnitude}.
And {K magnitude} is not less than {M magnitude}.
Thus, {GH magnitude} not less than {M magnitude} either.
And {FG magnitude} (is) greater than {D magnitude}.
Thus, the whole of {FH magnitude} is greater than {D magnitude} and {M magnitude} (added) together.
But, {D magnitude} and {M magnitude} (added) together is equal to {N magnitude}, inasmuch as {M magnitude} is three times {D magnitude}, and {M magnitude} and {D magnitude} (added) together is four times {D magnitude}, and {N magnitude} is also four times {D magnitude}.
Thus, {M magnitude} and {D magnitude} (added) together is equal to {N magnitude}.
But, {FH magnitude} is greater than {M magnitude} and {D magnitude}.
Thus, {FH magnitude} exceeds {N magnitude}.
And {K magnitude} does not exceed {N magnitude}.
And {FH magnitude}, {K magnitude} are equal multiples of {AB magnitude}, {C magnitude}, and {N magnitude} another random multiple of {D magnitude}.
Thus, {AB magnitude} has a greater ratio to {D magnitude} than {C magnitude} (has) to {D magnitude} [Def. 5.7].

So, I say that {D magnitude} also has a greater ratio to {C magnitude} than {D magnitude} (has) to {AB magnitude}.

For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show that {N magnitude} exceeds {K magnitude}, and {N magnitude} does not exceed {FH magnitude}.
And {N magnitude} is a multiple of {D magnitude}, and {FH magnitude}, {K magnitude} other random equal multiples of {AB magnitude}, {C magnitude} (respectively).
Thus, {D magnitude} has a greater ratio to {C magnitude} than {D magnitude} (has) to {AB magnitude} [Def. 5.5].

{figure 2}And so let {AE magnitude} be greater than {EB magnitude}.
So, the lesser, {EB magnitude}, being multiplied, will sometimes be greater than {D magnitude}.
Let it have been multiplied, and let {GH magnitude} be a multiple of {EB magnitude} (which is) greater than {D magnitude}.
And as many times as {GH magnitude} is (divisible) by {EB magnitude}, so many times let {FG magnitude} also have become (divisible) by {AE magnitude}, and {K magnitude} by {C magnitude}.
So, similarly (to the above), we can show that {FH magnitude} and {K magnitude} are equal multiples of {AB magnitude} and {C magnitude} (respectively).
And, similarly (to the above), let the multiple {N magnitude} of {D magnitude}, (which is) the first (multiple) greater than {FG magnitude}, have been taken.
So, {FG magnitude} is again not less than {M magnitude}.
And {GH magnitude} (is) greater than {D magnitude}.
Thus, the whole of {FH magnitude} exceeds {D magnitude} and {M magnitude}, that is to say {N magnitude}.
And {K magnitude} does not exceed {N magnitude}, inasmuch as {FG magnitude}, which (is) greater than {GH magnitude} ---that is to say, {K magnitude} ---also does not exceed {N magnitude}.
And, following the above (arguments), we (can) complete the proof in the same manner.

Thus, for unequal magnitudes, the greater (magnitude) has a greater ratio than the lesser to the same (magnitude).
And the latter (magnitude) has a greater ratio to the lesser (magnitude) than to the greater.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
